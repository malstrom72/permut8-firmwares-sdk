# Impala Language Reference

Impala is a small, imperative, C-like language that compiles to the GAZL virtual
machine. It is deliberately close to the underlying assembly: there is little
optimization, types are minimal, and most constructs map almost one-to-one to GAZL
instructions. Think of it as a high-level assembler.

This document is the language reference. For a feature-rich program with extensive
inline commentary, see `impala/ImpalaDemo.impala`. For the host API exposed to
Permut8 firmware (entry points, native functions, globals), see
[Permut8 Firmware API](../../docs/Permut8%20Firmware%20API.md).

The authoritative grammar is `impala/impala.ppeg`; this reference follows it.

## Lexical elements

### Comments

```impala
// Line comment, C++ style.
/* Block comment. Does not nest. */
```

### Identifiers and keywords

Identifiers start with a letter, `_`, or `$` and continue with letters, digits, `_`,
or `$`. The following words are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers:

```
abs array assert case const copy default do else extern float floor for from
ftoi funcptr function global goto if int itof locals loop native null nullfunc
pointer readonly returns switch temporary to while
```

### Integer literals

Three forms are accepted:

```impala
123          // decimal
0x1F         // hexadecimal
'A'          // character literal — the word value of the character(s)
'abcd'       // multi-character literal, packed into one word
```

### Float literals

A float **must** have at least one digit on both sides of the decimal point, with an
optional exponent. There is no float suffix; the decimal point is what distinguishes a
float from an integer.

```impala
1.0          // valid
3.14159
6.022e23
1.           // INVALID — needs a digit after the point
.5           // INVALID — needs a digit before the point
```

### String literals

A string literal yields a pointer to a zero-terminated array of word-sized characters
(words are typically 32-bit). Its type is the generic `pointer`.

```impala
const pointer WELCOME = "Welcome to Impala!\n"
```

The supported escape sequences are `\"`, `\\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and
`\uXXXX` (exactly four hex digits).

## Types

There are four primitive types, all one VM word wide (standard configuration 32-bit):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `int` | signed integer |
| `float` | floating point |
| `pointer` | generic pointer (untyped target) |
| `funcptr` | function pointer |

Arrays and pointers carry **no** compile-time element type — they are untyped storage.
Function arguments and return values are likewise untyped. Because of this, casts are
common (see [Casting](#casting)). A side effect of this simplicity is that external
functions need no prototypes, and multiple Impala sources can be linked simply by
concatenating their assembled `.gazl` output.

## Declarations

### Globals

Global variables live in slow global memory. The `global` keyword must prefix a global
both at its declaration and at **every** access. The prefix is a constant reminder that
global access is more expensive than local access, so audio-rate code should minimize it.

```impala
global int uninited
global int inited = 23
global float aFloat
global pointer aPointer = &global aFloat
global funcptr aFuncPointer
global array defaultArray[100]
```

Initializers for globals must be compile-time constants.

### `const`

`const` introduces a compile-time constant (a *define*). It occupies no memory and can
be used for array sizes and other compile-time values. The value must be a compile-time
constant expression.

```impala
const int SOME_COUNT = 4
```

Some constants are supplied by the VM or host at load time and are declared without a
value:

```impala
const int GAZL_WORD_SIZE
const int DEBUG
```

### `readonly`

`readonly` data is stored in global memory but cannot be modified — any attempt to write
it is a runtime error. Unlike `const`, it is real storage and is accessed with the
`global` keyword.

```impala
readonly int IMMUTABLE = 42
readonly array SOME_CONSTS[SOME_COUNT] = { 100, 200, 300, 400 }
```

Read a readonly array with the `global` prefix even though the declaration begins with
`readonly`:

```impala
x = (int) global SOME_CONSTS[i]
```

### `temporary`

Marks a global that the host does not need to serialize when saving VM state:

```impala
temporary int forgetMe
```

### `extern`

Introduces a symbol defined elsewhere. Native functions supplied by the host use
`extern native`:

```impala
extern int defineMeLaterPlease
extern array futureArray
extern function thisFunctionInAnotherSource
extern native abort
```

### Arrays

Only one-dimensional arrays are supported. Elements may hold any mix of values, and the
size must be a compile-time constant. Array initializers must be compile-time constants.

```impala
global array initedArray[10] = {
        1, 2.0, &global defaultArray[0], 4
}
```

### Function pointers

Function pointers use the `funcptr` type, are assigned and called like any other
pointer, and can be tested against `nullfunc`:

```impala
global aFuncPointer = showoff
if (global aFuncPointer != nullfunc)
        global aFuncPointer()
```

`null` is the corresponding null value for ordinary `pointer`s.

## Functions

A function declares arguments, optional return value, and optional locals. Arguments and
the return value are untyped storage; their `int`/`float`/etc. declarations only name the
slot.

```impala
function fetchSomeConst(int index)
returns int fetched
{
        fetched = (int) global SOME_CONSTS[index]
}
```

Locals are declared in a single `locals` clause and may include arrays:

```impala
function test()
locals int i, array mydata[TEST_SIZE]
{
        for (i = 0 to TEST_SIZE)
                mydata[i] = myrand()
}
```

Functions cannot be nested. There are no prototypes; a function may call another defined
later in the same source or in another linked source.

## Statements

### Assignment

Assignment uses `=` and is itself an expression that yields the assigned value, so it may
appear inside a larger expression:

```impala
a = b = 0
while ((c = nextValue()) != 0) { /* ... */ }
```

There are no compound assignment operators (`+=`, `&=`, …) and no `++`/`--`.

The assignable forms (lvalues) are a variable, a pointer dereference `*p`, and a
subscript `a[i]`.

### Conditionals

```impala
if (x > 0)
        positive()
else if (x < 0)
        negative()
else
        zero()
```

The condition is a parenthesized boolean expression (see
[Conditions](#conditions-and-boolean-expressions)).

### Loops

`for` increments its variable by one and stops **before** the upper bound. The
initializer is optional, and the loop variable must be a local `int` or `pointer`:

```impala
for (i = 0 to TEST_SIZE)        // i runs 0,1,...,TEST_SIZE-1
        mydata[i] = myrand()

for (i to TEST_SIZE)            // reuses i's current value as the start
        consume(i)
```

Other loops:

```impala
while (cond) { /* ... */ }
do { /* ... */ } while (cond)
loop { /* runs forever; exit with goto or return */ }
```

Use `goto` and labels to break out of loops manually:

```impala
loop {
        if (done) goto finished;
        step();
}
finished:
```

### `switch`

`switch` tests an integer expression against an inclusive range written as
`== low to high`. If the value falls outside the range, the `default` case runs. Cases do
**not** fall through, so there is no `break`. A case can list several values.

```impala
switch (i == 0 to 10) {
        case 0,1,2: {
                j = i
        }
        case 5: x()
        default: j = -1
}
```

### `copy`

Copies a fixed number of words from one pointer to another. The count must be a
compile-time constant.

```impala
copy(3 from &global initedArray[1] to &global futureArray[0])
```

### `assert`

Performs a runtime check, but only when the `DEBUG` constant is non-zero. When `DEBUG`
is zero the check (and its message) are compiled out.

```impala
assert(i != 0);
```

## Expressions

### Operator precedence

From loosest to tightest binding:

| Group | Operators | Associativity |
|---|---|---|
| Assignment | `=` | right |
| Bitwise / shift | `\|` `&` `^` `<<` `>>` `>>>` | left |
| Additive | `+` `-` | left |
| Multiplicative | `*` `/` `%` | left |
| Prefix / postfix | prefix `-` `~` `&` `*`, casts `(type)`, `abs` `floor` `itof` `ftoi`; postfix `()` `[]` | — |

> **Important:** all bitwise and shift operators share **one** precedence level that
> binds *looser* than `+` and `-`. This is **not** the same as C. For example,
> `x & 0xFF + 1` parses as `x & (0xFF + 1)`, and `a << 2 + 1` parses as `a << (2 + 1)`.
> When mixing bitwise/shift operators with arithmetic, parenthesize explicitly. The
> example firmwares always do, e.g. `((clock + 1024) & 65535) >> 12`.

Details that are easy to miss:

- `>>` is an **arithmetic** right shift and preserves the sign bit. `>>>` is a **logical**
  right shift that fills with zeroes — usually what you want for bit masks, hashing, and
  random-number generators.
- `~` is bitwise NOT; `^`, `&`, `|` are the other bitwise operators.
- `%` is integer modulo only. There is no float modulo.

### Conditions and boolean expressions

The comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, the logical operators `&&`
and `||`, and the logical NOT `!` exist **only** inside the parenthesized condition of
`if`, `while`, `do…while`, and `assert`. They do not produce values you can store or pass
around:

```impala
if (0 <= x && x < limit) { /* ok */ }

flag = (a < b)        // INVALID — comparisons are not values
```

`&&` and `||` short-circuit. To capture a comparison result, branch on it and assign
inside the branches.

### Casting

A cast `(type) expr` reinterprets a value's type; it does **not** convert the
representation. To convert between integers and floats use the built-ins `itof()` and
`ftoi()`.

```impala
f = itof(n)           // int -> float (value conversion)
n = ftoi(f)           // float -> int (value conversion)
p = (pointer) x       // retype only, no conversion
```

Because function return values and pointer/array elements are untyped, they usually need
a cast before use in a typed context:

```impala
y = (int) lfoVal(...) + 1     // a bare untyped value + int needs the cast
z = lfoVal(...)               // a plain assignment is fine without it
```

### Built-in functions

Impala has exactly four built-in functions; everything else is either a statement
keyword (`copy`, `assert`) or a host-supplied `extern native` function.

| Built-in | Description |
|---|---|
| `abs(x)` | absolute value; works on `int` and `float` |
| `floor(x)` | floor; works on `float` |
| `itof(n)` | convert `int` to `float` |
| `ftoi(f)` | convert `float` to `int` |

Trigonometric and exponential functions are **not** built in. Either precompute them into
tables at load time (`ringmod_code.impala` builds a cosine table with a Taylor series in
`init()`), or copy a ready-made implementation from the snippets library described below.

### Standard snippets library

Impala has no `#include` and no separate compilation units, so there is no linked
standard library. Instead, [`examples/Firmwares/Impala Snippets.txt`](../../examples/Firmwares/Impala%20Snippets.txt)
collects reusable, copy-paste functions and data. Copy only what a firmware needs. It
includes:

- **Math**: `exp`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `trunc`,
  `round`, `ceil`, `fmod`, `minInt`/`maxInt`, `minFloat`/`maxFloat`, the `xorShiftRandom`
  generator, and constants such as `PI`, `E`, and `HALF_PI`.
- **Strings**: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, `strncmp`, `stpcpy`.
- **Conversion**: `intToString`, `floatToString`, `stringToFloat`.
- **Tracing**: `traceInt`, `traceInts`, `traceFloat`, `traceFloats`, and `error`.
- **Permut8 tables**: `EIGHT_BIT_EXP_TABLE` and `SEVEN_BIT_EXP_TABLE`, the exact
  exponential tables used by the built-in operators (see
  [Operand Scaling Conventions](../../docs/Operand%20Scaling%20Conventions.md)).

(The other way to share code is to assemble each source separately and concatenate the
resulting `.gazl` files, since linking is just concatenation.)

### Pointers and arrays

`&` takes an address; `*` dereferences. Pointer arithmetic is supported: `pointer + int`
and `pointer - int` yield a pointer, and `pointer - pointer` yields the `int` element
distance.

```impala
global pointer p = &global defaultArray[0]
x = *(p + 3)
```

The subscript `[]` works on any pointer, not just declared arrays: `p[i]` is equivalent to
`*(p + i)`. The index may be negative, and the pointer may even be a string literal:

```impala
last = (int) p[-1]
hexDigit = ("0123456789abcdef")[value & 0xf]
```

## The Impala tools

The compiler and test suite are written in
[PikaScript](https://github.com/mjs/pikascript) and shipped as `.pika` files under
`impala/`:

- `impala.pika` – command line driver able to `rebuild`, `compile`, or `run` programs
- `impalaCompiler.pika` – generated compiler produced by the `rebuild` step
- `initPPEG.pika` – initializes the parsing library
- `systools.pika` – small helper routines used by the scripts
- `runTests.pika` – compiles all sources in the test suite

`PikaCmd` executes these scripts. The build system compiles PikaCmd from
`externals/PikaCmd` and places the executable in `output/`. The `BuildImpala` scripts
then call `PikaCmd impala.pika rebuild` to create `impalaCompiler.pika` before copying all
required files to `output/` for convenient use.

## Compiling and running

After running `bash build.sh` the `output/` folder contains `PikaCmd` and `GAZLCmd`.
Compile an Impala source file like so:

```bash
cd output
./PikaCmd impala.pika compile ../impala/ImpalaDemo.impala demo.gazl
```

Execute the resulting program with the VM:

```bash
./GAZLCmd demo.gazl main
```

For convenience you can compile and run in one step:

```bash
./PikaCmd impala.pika run ../impala/ImpalaDemo.impala
```
