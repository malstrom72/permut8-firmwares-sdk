# Documentation

End-user documentation for GAZL, Impala and the C++ embedding API. If you are working ON the compiler or
the VM rather than WITH them, you want [`design/`](../design/README.md) instead - design notes, audits,
proposals and backlogs live there, and nothing in this folder assumes you have read them.

**Categories.** REFERENCE = an inventory, verify before relying on it. SPEC = the design of something,
which may or may not be built.

## Start here

| Doc | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [WhatsNewInImpala2](impala/WhatsNewInImpala2.md) | REFERENCE | **What changed from 1.0, in one page.** Every sample on it is compiled by `impala/docSamples.js` on each build, so it cannot drift |
| [Overview](Overview.md) | REFERENCE | Architecture and goals; how the VM works and **how to embed it from C++** |
| [UsageExample](impala/UsageExample.md) | REFERENCE | Compile and run a simple program |

## GAZL

| Doc | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [InstructionSet](gazl/InstructionSet.md) | REFERENCE | Extracted opcode descriptions |

The C++ embedding API is currently a section of [Overview](Overview.md) rather than its own page;
extracting it to `gazl/Embedding.md` is planned.

## Impala

| Doc | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [Impala](impala/Impala.md) | **REFERENCE** | **The language.** One page, and the only one you need to write Impala: lexis, types, `struct` and `functype`, declarations, statements, expressions, `import`/`export`, and the signature metadata the compiler emits |
| [Impala2](impala/Impala2.md) | SPEC | **Why** 2.0 is shaped as it is - the design record behind the reference, including what was considered and rejected. Not needed to use the language |
| [MultidimensionalArrays](impala/MultidimensionalArrays.md) | SPEC (implemented) | Array SHAPES - `int array cells[H, W]`, `a[y, x]`, the per-axis `.d.` constants, and per-axis bounds checking in all three tiers |
| [MemorySafetyModel](impala/MemorySafetyModel.md) | REFERENCE | Frames, what is bounds-checked and when, what `*size` is for, and what a variable holds before you assign it |

`Impala.md` no longer hands `struct`, `functype`, `sizeof` or `import` off to `Impala2.md` - the reference
documents the language it describes. `MultidimensionalArrays.md` is still a separate page.

## The rule that keeps this from rotting

One fact, one home. If something belongs in two docs, put it in the one that owns the subject and
**link** from the other - a copied paragraph is a paragraph that will disagree with itself later. Both
stale-blocker incidents this repo has had came from copies, not from missing information.
