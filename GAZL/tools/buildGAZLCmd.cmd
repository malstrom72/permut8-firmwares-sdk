REM Propagate the compile result BEFORE anything else runs. A script's exit status is its LAST command,
REM and the `IF EXIST`/`ATTRIB` below succeeds whatever happened - so a FAILED build reported success and
REM `build.cmd` sailed straight past its own `IF ERRORLEVEL 1`. That is how a stale GAZLCmd.exe shipped
REM while the build called itself green: the linker could not overwrite a copy still held open by an
REM earlier run (LNK1104), printed the error, and nothing downstream noticed.
