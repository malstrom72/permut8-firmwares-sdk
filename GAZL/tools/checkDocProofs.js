/*
	The hand-written .gazl fragments under docs/ are "runnable proofs" - a claim in prose that can be
	executed instead of believed. Nothing ran them, which is the failure mode this file exists to close:
	a proof nobody runs is a claim that rots silently, and these are the claims a reader is LEAST likely
	to re-derive, because they demonstrate things the compiler cannot emit yet.

	Every expectation below is copied from the fragment's own header comment or from the doc that cites
	it, so this file asserts what the docs promise and not something separately invented. When a proof
	and its doc disagree, one of them is wrong and the build should say so.

	Degrades rather than fails without output/GAZLCmd, exactly as runJspegTests and jspegCompilerTests
	do - tools/test-js.sh is the no-C++-toolchain gate and must stay runnable on a bare checkout.
