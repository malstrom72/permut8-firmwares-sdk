/*
	NuXJS <-> node PARITY.

	`impalaCompiler.js` has to run under NuXJS as well as node, and until 2026-08-07 nothing in the gate
	checked that. `tools/run-nuxjs-impala-smoke.cmd` compiles four programs; none of them declares a SHAPE,
	so `arrayExtent`'s `dims.map(...)` sat there breaking every multidimensional program under NuXJS
	("TypeError: map is not a function") from commit 1aae39a until it was found by hand. This exists so the
	next one is caught by the gate instead.

	Both engines are driven through their own CLI entry (`impala.node.js` / `impala.nuxjs.js`) so the two
	sides format identically - the goldens are NOT usable as the reference here, because runJspegTests
	writes them through a different harness that omits the CLI's leading space.

	The list is a SUBSET chosen to span the feature matrix rather than the whole corpus, so the gate stays
	quick; `--all` runs every source. Keep `multidimFields` in it whatever else changes - it is the witness
	for the bug that motivated the file.
