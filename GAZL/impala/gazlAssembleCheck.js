   This exists because compiling clean does NOT mean the GAZL assembles: a struct field's folded extent
   used to be emitted after the layout block that read it, which every golden and a million fuzzed
   programs missed because nothing ever fed a golden to the assembler. Nothing else covers it: the

/* A fixture with no run line is still fed to the assembler, because "compiles clean" and "loads"
   are different claims and only the second one catches a label this compiler emitted but never
   defined. Most such fixtures are firmware that links against a host, so a symbol complaint about
   a name that is NOT module-local (a plain global, or the `.o.`/`.z.` layout symbols an extern
   struct leaves to the host) means "out of scope here", not "broken" - whether it is missing, or
   already taken by a native GAZLCmd itself registers. A module-local `.` name is ours to answer
   for, so `.l0` or a duplicate `.s4#6` still reds the build.

   Known blind spot: GAZLCmd stops at the FIRST unresolved symbol, so a host name near the top of a
   module waves the REST of it through unchecked - hence the separate summary count. Supplying the
   missing names as `<define> <value>` pairs does not fix it: about as many fixtures define
   `DEBUG`/`PARAM_COUNT` themselves and would then collide (measured: 22 linked -> 8).

   Measured AGAIN 2026-08-03, this time feeding back whatever symbol the assembler stops at, in a loop,
   so a collision cannot happen by construction. It still does not pay, and the reason is not fixable
   from here. Of the 50 modules that do not assemble today, the loop gains 6; the rest divide into
   21 `Offset out of bounds`, 14 `Exception` and 9 `Symbol already defined`. The first group is the
   point: these constants are host-owned SIZES and INDICES (`PARAM_COUNT`, `OPERATOR_1_PARAM_INDEX`,
   ...), declared valueless in the sources on purpose, and no manifest in this repo carries the real
   numbers - so any value invented here is wrong often enough to turn a blind spot into a FALSE red,
   which is strictly worse than an honest "not checked". Do not measure this a third time without the
   actual Permut8 constants in hand; with them it is worth revisiting, because assembly is the gate
   that catches what byte-comparison cannot. */
