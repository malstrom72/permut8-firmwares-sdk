// Generative fuzzer for the Impala compiler.
//
// It emits random, mostly type-valid Impala programs that lean on the intricate paths
// (nested calls, struct locals/fields/copies, arrays, pointers, funcptr dispatch) and compiles
// each one. By-value struct params, struct returns, multi-value returns and destructuring are
// parked for Impala 3.0 (see design/ParkedFeatures.md) so they are no longer generated.
// The oracle is robustness:
//   - a clean coded diagnostic (`error[Exxx]`) is an ACCEPTABLE outcome (invalid program),
//   - a raw JS exception or an internal `Assertion failed` (e.g. the transient-register
//     `validateStock` checks) is a COMPILER BUG.
// Every compiled program is also DEAD-STRIPPED, because `deadStrip` reads the emitted GAZL back with
// its own idea of where a block starts and ends, and a throw from it is that reading going wrong on
// output the compiler accepted. It threw on every symbolically-sized initializer - the shape section
// (4) below now generates - while 3000 fuzz programs stayed green, purely because nothing here called
// it. `main` is exported so the strip has a root to walk from.
//
// Control flow covers `if`/`else`/`switch`/`for`/`do`-while/`loop`/`goto`. The last three were added
// after a landed fix for two dangling-label shapes in the short-circuit pass was found to have exactly
// one hand-written fixture and no fuzz coverage at all - the generator emitted none of the three. Both
// shapes are now built on purpose (see genDoWhile); reverting that fix makes this fuzzer fail at seed 14.
//
// Deterministic: every program is produced from a seeded PRNG, so any failure reproduces
// from its printed seed.
//
// Usage: node impala/fuzzImpala.js [iterations] [startSeed] [--vm]
//   --vm also runs each compiled program on GAZLCmd, supplying a randomly PERMUTED host layout for the
//   checked `extern struct`. It flags two different things: a VM fault (the module failed to load, or
//   trapped), and a WRONG VALUE - `main` prints a set of checked globals before its random body, and the
//   driver compares that prefix of stdout against the words the generator computed. The second is a real
//   REFERENCE oracle: it sees output that assembled and ran perfectly while holding the wrong numbers,
//   which no crash oracle can. --vm additionally runs the DEAD-STRIPPED module and requires byte-identical
//   stdout - a third reference oracle, over what the strip removed rather than over what the compiler
//   emitted. Without --vm the run is compile-only, so none of the three apply.
// Long sweeps are chunked across processes (for s in 0 20000 40000; do ... done) to cap the memory a
// single node process accumulates - NOT because the compiler is reloaded per call, which it stopped
// being when impalaJsCompilerRunner started caching the module (it cost ~5x on fuzz runs).
// First find (seed 10024): finishDestructure released its output window low-to-high (unlike every
// other multi-slot window), leaving a freed hole below a live temp; a later struct-arg call's
// window overlapped it. Fixed by releasing the window high-to-low; borrowForCall now asserts the
// pool-reaches-the-top invariant, so a future release-order regression fails loudly here.

//
// `checkExpected` below is now a second reference oracle, over static initializers rather than over
// code. It was added because that path had NO fuzz coverage at all - the generator emitted only bare

// replace the inline differential; the two cover different halves.
//
// What it reaches, all int-only so the comparison is exact: the fill loops, named-field mapping,
// zero-fill, nested structs and array fields (the recursion a value can cross into its neighbour
// through), the struct-array path, a SYMBOLIC extent (`sv[SN]` - Impala never learns SN, so every
// offset past it is assemble-time arithmetic and `tail` lands correctly only if that resolved), and an
// `extern struct` handed a PERMUTED layout at load, which a baked positional offset could not survive.
// The symbolic array is filled statically half the time and at run time the other half - the two check
// different halves (the DATA row landing inside a block whose size is not a number yet, versus the
// address arithmetic that reads it back). The extern struct stays run-time-only: E459 still allows
// nothing but zero there, since the host, not the assembler, owns that layout.
