# Repository Guidelines

## Read this before touching Impala or GAZL

Two invariants govern almost every design decision in this repository. Getting either wrong produces
changes that look reasonable and are wrong at the level of the whole system.

**1. Impala is a transliterator, not a compiler.** The ~1:1 mapping between Impala constructs and GAZL
instructions is sacred. No hidden optimization passes, no runtime machinery the programmer cannot
predict from the source, and never stricter than the machine it targets. Optimization belongs in the
assembler, where more is known. See the design principles in [`docs/impala/Impala2.md`](docs/impala/Impala2.md).

**2. The build has TWO stages, and a constant is not always a number Impala knows.** GAZL programs are
distributed as assembly TEXT, and that text is assembled on the END USER's machine immediately before
running. The host injects named constant values at that moment (`Symbols::defineConstant`, `! DEFi`,
`<A>`-`<Z>`, `! IFDF`), so one shipped `.gazl` file compiles to different code under different
conditions. Impala therefore emits references to constants whose values it never saw, and that is
correct and intended, not a gap to close. Do not make Impala demand a numeric value where a symbol
would do; do not fold a named constant away; do not treat "not known at Impala compile time" as an
error. The full rules, with verified examples, are in
[`design/impala/TwoStageConstants.md`](design/impala/TwoStageConstants.md) - **read it before changing any constant
handling, folding, bounds check or diagnostic.**

Say "Impala compile time" or "GAZL assembly time" explicitly. Bare "compile time" is ambiguous here
and is the usual root of the mistake.

## Building and testing

For a change that touches only the JavaScript compiler, the fast gate is enough. It needs no C++
toolchain, and `build.sh` and `build.cmd` both call it, so the two cannot drift apart:

```bash
timeout 300 bash tools/test-js.sh
```

The full sequence builds the C++ tools as well, and runs the demo end to end:

```bash
timeout 900 bash build.sh
```

Always run one of these before committing, and the full one before committing anything outside
`impala/`. Budget generously: the JS gate alone takes about a minute and a half, most of it a
3000-program fuzz run.

## Code style

The canonical coding style and design principles live in [`design/CodingStyle.md`](design/CodingStyle.md) and are
shared across these projects, so there is one source of truth. Follow it for error handling, RAII, naming, class
layout, comments, and formatting. This file holds only the operational notes specific to this repository.

## Repository layout
The project uses a consistent folder structure. Build output is written to `output/` and no source files live there. Useful locations:

- `tools/` - scripts for building and maintaining the code and documentation, plus the C++ sources
  that are not part of the VM library itself (`GAZLCmd.cpp`, `GAZLWasm.cpp`, `GAZLEnterCallTest.cpp`).
- `projects/` - Xcode and Visual Studio project files.
- `docs/` - end-user documentation for GAZL, Impala and the C++ embedding API.
- `design/` - design notes, audits, proposals and internals, for working ON the toolchain. Start at `design/README.md`.
- `externals/` - projects and source code from other repositories (only touch this content when explicitly asked to).
- `src/` - C++ source code for the library. The library is distributed as source rather than prebuilt binaries.
- `tests/` - regression tests.
- `output/` - contains only build artifacts (and any runtime dependencies), no source files.

Root-level `build.sh` and `build.cmd` (mirrored implementations) should build and test both the beta and release targets.

BuildCpp.sh and BuildCpp.cmd are copied from another repository. Only make changes to them if there is no other solution.

## Formatting rules

Code style (indentation, braces, line width, comments, naming) is defined in
[`design/CodingStyle.md`](design/CodingStyle.md). Only the operational hygiene note below is repo-specific.

When handling files with command-line tools (which may break tab characters):
- Always run `expand -t 4` on the file before processing.
- Always run `unexpand -t 4` on the file after processing.

## Script portability
All user-facing `.sh` and `.cmd` files must work when launched from any directory.
They should start by changing to their own folder (or the repository root) so that
relative paths resolve correctly.

`.sh` scripts must be runnable without requiring `chmod +x`; always invoke them with  
`bash path/to/script.sh` (do **not** rely on the system-default `sh`).  
Each script must start with a portable she-bang:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e -o pipefail -u
```

Every `.sh` script must have a corresponding `.cmd` implementation with identical behavior. Use `.cmd` files rather than `.bat`.

```
# example for a shell script
cd "$(dirname "$0")"/..
```

REM example for a .cmd script  
```
CD /D "%~dp0\.."
```

For robust error handling, `.sh` scripts should begin as shown above, and `.cmd`
scripts normally use a simple error check:

```
CALL buildAndTest.cmd %target% || GOTO error
EXIT /b 0
:error
EXIT /b %ERRORLEVEL%
```

## Code Formatting

All JavaScript files in this repository should be formatted with Prettier using tab indentation.

- Install Prettier if necessary:
  ```sh
  npm install --no-save prettier
  ```
- Format sources before committing:
  ```sh
  npx prettier --write .
  ```

This project includes a Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc.json`) that enforces tab-based indentation and a wider print width.
