# Fuzzing

Version: 2026-10-07c

How these projects fuzz with libFuzzer. Every copy of this file is identical apart from the "Local additions" section
at the end, which holds a project's targets, scripts and exceptions.

## Machines

- The Mac (clang, AddressSanitizer plus UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) is the main fuzzing machine. It is the fastest per
  worker and the only one with both sanitizers by default.
- Windows runs MSVC `/fsanitize=address /fsanitize=fuzzer` by default. It adds capacity and covers what only Windows
  has: 32-bit `long`, the MSVC compiler and runtime, and the Win32 backends.
- clang-cl on Windows is allowed only for a build that has passed the throw test under "clang-cl on Windows".
- Check the load before starting (`uptime` on the Mac) and keep to about 4 workers per campaign while other projects
  are running. Watch free disk space: nothing stops a run when the disk fills.

## Building

Build optimized with asserts on: the release target plus `/U NDEBUG` (MSVC, clang-cl) or `-UNDEBUG` (clang). Never
`-O0`, which is several times slower. Release is required on Windows anyway, because libFuzzer links against the
static release runtime.

- Mac clang: `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all -UNDEBUG`.
- MSVC: `/fsanitize=address /fsanitize=fuzzer /U NDEBUG`, and copy MSVC's `clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll` next to
  the executable. The two options must be separate: MSVC ignores clang's comma form with only a warning, and the link
  then fails with a misleading missing-entry-point error.

Link with an 8 MB stack on Windows (`/link /STACK:8388608`), since deep recursion otherwise overflows the 1 MB default
long before it would on the Mac.

### clang-cl on Windows

clang-cl's sanitizer instrumentation breaks MSVC C++ exception handling. A target that throws can crash inside
`__CxxFrameHandler3` (an access violation, often at `0xffffffffffffffff`), stop with exit code `0x80000003`, or
silently run the wrong code. A build needs all of the following:

- `/Ob0`: SanitizerCoverage puts callbacks in catch blocks without the funclet bundle, so the rest of the handler is
  replaced with unreachable code (llvm#212404). Without inlining, fewer comparisons land in catch blocks. This makes
  the bug rarer; it does not remove it.
- `-fsanitize-address-use-after-return=never`: ASan's fake stack breaks unwinding.
- `/D _DISABLE_STRING_ANNOTATION /D _DISABLE_VECTOR_ANNOTATION`: otherwise linking fails on `annotate_string`.
- The release target: libFuzzer needs the static release runtime (`/MT`).

Copy LLVM's `clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll` (from `lib\clang\<version>\lib\windows`), not MSVC's. With BuildCpp,
quote the compiler path because it contains a space:
`CPP_COMPILER="C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang-cl.exe"`.

The throw test: before a clang-cl build is trusted, replay a corpus in which most inputs make the target throw through
both that build and a plain build of the same target without sanitizers, and require identical outcomes (status and
output) for every input. Zero crashes is not enough, since a handler cut short can run on to the wrong result without
crashing. The reference must be truly plain: with coverage instrumentation (`-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link`) it breaks in
the same way, and the comparison proves nothing. Repeat the test whenever LLVM is updated.

## The harness

Remove every route to files, the console and the system from the target itself. Replacing a variable or a name is not
enough when the same function can still be reached another way.

A differential target, which compares implementations of the same thing, cannot find a bug they all share, such as a
range check that overflows the same way in each. It complements reading the bounds checks; it does not replace it.

Turn off CRT dialogs in `LLVMFuzzerInitialize`, or a failed assert hangs the worker on a message box:

```cpp
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
	_set_error_mode(_OUT_TO_STDERR);
	_set_abort_behavior(0, _WRITE_ABORT_MSG | _CALL_REPORTFAULT);
	_CrtSetReportMode(_CRT_ASSERT, _CRTDBG_MODE_FILE);
	_CrtSetReportFile(_CRT_ASSERT, _CRTDBG_FILE_STDERR);
	_CrtSetReportMode(_CRT_ERROR, _CRTDBG_MODE_FILE);
	_CrtSetReportFile(_CRT_ERROR, _CRTDBG_FILE_STDERR);
#endif
```

## Running

- Pass `-artifact_prefix=<folder>/`, or crash files land in the current directory, which is easy to commit by mistake.
- Pass a scratch folder as the first corpus directory, since libFuzzer writes new inputs there. Use forward slashes in
  `-dict` paths on Windows.
- Mac environment:
  ```bash
  symbolizer="$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/llvm-symbolizer"
  export ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_container_overflow=0:external_symbolizer_path=$symbolizer"
  export UBSAN_OPTIONS="print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1:external_symbolizer_path=$symbolizer"
  ```
  `detect_container_overflow=0` avoids false reports from uninstrumented system libraries. The explicit symbolizer
  avoids a deadlock in `atos`.
- Start runs longer than half an hour with `nohup caffeinate -i ... & disown`, so that neither sleep nor the end of the
  session that started them stops them.
- Do not raise `-rss_limit_mb` to reproduce an out-of-memory input on a shared machine. Swap comes out of the same
  disk, and one 8 GB reproduction took 3 GB of a nearly full Mac disk.
- Keep `-jobs` small (a few thousand at most). A run that crashes while loading its corpus restarts job after job,
  looks busy and fuzzes nothing; a small cap ends that loop quickly and visibly. Watch the job logs as well.

## Corpus and regression

- `tests/fuzz/` holds a minimized corpus archive per target, a dictionary and hand-made seeds.
- Refresh an archive only after a substantial run: merge with `-merge=1` into an empty folder, then pack
  deterministically:
  ```bash
  tar --sort=name --owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner --mtime='2000-01-01 00:00Z' -cf - corpus | gzip -9n
  ```
  GNU tar and bsdtar do not produce identical archives, so refresh with GNU tar. Use `xz -9` only where it saves a
  lot: the `tar.exe` that ships with Windows cannot read xz and hangs instead of failing.
- The normal build replays the corpus, the seeds and every past crash input through a plain `main()` that reads files
  and calls `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. It is built without fuzzer instrumentation, with every compiler the project uses,
  and never with clang-cl's sanitizers, which would bring back the exception handling bugs above. Unpack each archive
  into an empty folder, or inputs left from the previous archive are replayed too.
- Commit the input of each fixed crash as a plain file in `tests/fuzz/<target>Crashes/`, outside the archives:
  `-merge=1` drops any input whose features others already cover, fixed crashes included. Mark these files `binary`
  in `.gitattributes`, so line-ending conversion cannot rewrite them.
- Only inputs for fixed defects belong in a corpus or the crash folder. Keep the input for a known, still unfixed
  defect in a separate folder until the fix lands, or it aborts a run that stops on the first error while the corpus
  loads.
- Keep a crash file from a Windows clang-cl build only if it also crashes with MSVC or on the Mac.

## Local additions

GAZL's lanes, and the one place it departs from the shared rules.

- **Three targets, not one.** The JIT-vs-interpreter differential (`tools/GAZLCmd.cpp` under `-DJITDIFF`), the
  text-assembler crash lane (the same file under `-DLIBFUZZ` without `JITDIFF`), and the Impala compiler fuzzer
  (`impala/fuzzImpala.js`, pure JavaScript, which runs in the JS gate and needs no C++ toolchain).
- **A seed is `(generator version, seed)`, never a bare integer.** The generated program is a pure function of a
  choice stream, and that stream has changed: float branches, NaN/Inf and negative in-range indices were added, and
  the per-statement `pick()` fix made the stream compiler-independent. A seed quoted before those changes names a
  different program now, so every recorded result must say which generator produced it.
- **The differential lane cannot find a bug both engines share.** It checks that the interpreter and the JIT AGREE,
  not that either is right. A `COPY` bounds check that wrapped identically in the interpreter and in both JIT
  backends survived 600,000 generated programs across two backends, and was found by reading the check. Treat a
  clean differential run as evidence of agreement only.
- **Throughput depends entirely on what fraction of inputs the assembler rejects.** A rejected program costs a parse;
  an accepted one assembles AND RUNS across a 128K-`Value` data arena and a 128K-`Instruction` code arena with a
  10M-instruction timeout. Measured on the Windows MSVC lane: **~1300 execs/s** from a 31-program seed corpus, where
  most mutations are invalid and rejected cheaply, against **about 1/s** on a corpus of a single valid program that
  executes every time. So a throughput figure means nothing without the corpus it was measured on, and a campaign
  slowing down as its corpus grows is expected, not a fault.
- **UBSan is Mac-only for now.** clang-cl's instrumentation breaks MSVC C++ exception handling, and this assembler
  throws to reject a malformed program as its normal path, so a Windows clang-cl build can silently run the wrong
  code. The Windows lane uses MSVC `/fsanitize=fuzzer /fsanitize=address` (separate flags; the comma form is clang
  syntax and MSVC drops it with only a warning), which is ASan-only.
- **The CRT dialog fix lives in `quietAsserts()`**, called from both `main()`s in `tools/GAZLCmd.cpp`, rather than in
  `LLVMFuzzerInitialize`. Same effect: an unattended run fails instead of blocking on a message box.
- **`buildGazlFuzz.cmd` and `buildGazlFuzz.sh` are deliberately NOT behaviour-identical**, the one documented
  exception to this repo's rule that a `.sh` and its `.cmd` twin behave the same. The `.sh` uses clang with
  `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address` (and `undefined` on request); the `.cmd` uses MSVC's libFuzzer and ASan, because
  clang-cl is unusable for this target and MSVC has no UBSan. Both build the same fuzz target from the same sources;
  only the engine and the available sanitizers differ. `seedTextCorpus.cmd` IS a true twin, down to matching
  `find -size -8k`'s rounding to whole KiB, which excludes a file the obvious `< 8192` test would include.
- **The MSVC build needs `clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll` beside the exe**, or it exits `0xC0000135` anywhere but a
  developer prompt. `buildGazlFuzz.cmd` copies it from the Visual Studio tree; that is why it searches for it.
