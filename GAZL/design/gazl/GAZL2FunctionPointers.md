# A distinct function-pointer type for GAZL 2 (`t`)

Status: PROPOSAL, researched against `src/GAZL.cpp` and GAZLCmd on 2026-08-02. Nothing here is
implemented. The conclusion is that GAZL 1 has a real silent-wrong shape that no amount of Impala-side
checking can close, because Impala has nowhere to encode the distinction.

## The problem in one line

GAZL has three storage types - `i`, `f`, `p` - and **`p` is doing double duty**: it is both "data
pointer" and "function pointer", which are not the same thing and are not interchangeable.

## This is not a new rule - the ISA already states it

`docs/gazl/InstructionSet.md`, under `CALL`, has said so all along:

> A function pointer (the value of `&function`) is an opaque handle: a stable ordinal assigned in function
> declaration order, not a code address. Only equality (`EQUp` / `NEQp`) and calling are defined operations
> on a function pointer; ordering (`LSSp`, `GEQp` etc.) and arithmetic (`ADDp`, `SUBp`, `DIFp`) applied to
> a function pointer yield an unspecified (but memory-safe) result.

The defined operation set is therefore already **equality and calling** - exactly the set proposed below.
This document is not asking for a new rule; it is asking the assembler to ENFORCE the one already written
down, which a shared `p` type makes impossible. Note too that "unspecified (but memory-safe)" is accurate
but undersells `ADDp`: the result is not garbage, it is a *different function*, called silently.

## They are already different things at run time

This is not a type-system nicety layered over one representation. The two live in different numeric
spaces, deliberately:

```c
// src/GAZL.h:77-78
const Pointer MEMORY_OFFSET = 0x12345678;   // data pointers: memory offset + this
const Pointer FUNCTION_OFFSET = 0x56789ABC; // function pointers: FUNCTION ORDINAL + this
```

```c
// src/GAZL.cpp:1130
v.p = (Int)(FUNCTION_OFFSET + functionCount);
// "A function pointer is its stable declaration-order ordinal (not a code offset),
//  resolved through `functionTable` at call time."
```

So a data pointer is an *address* and a function pointer is an *index*. The ISA already knows they are
different; it just has no type to say so.

## What is checked today, and what is not

Verified with GAZLCmd on 2026-08-02:

| shape | today |
|---|---|
| `CALL &gdata` (direct call to a data label) | **rejected** - `Incompatible types: gdata` |
| `MOVp $p &gdata` then `CALL $p` | accepted; traps at run time as `BAD_CALL` |
| `MOVp $p &target` then `PEEK` through it | accepted; traps on the memory region check |
| `DATp &target &gdata` (both kinds, one row) | accepted, unchecked |
| `ADDp $p $p #1` on a function pointer | **accepted - and does NOT trap** |
| `DIFp $i $funcPtr $dataPtr` | accepted, meaningless result |
| `LSSp` / `GRTp` ordering two function pointers | accepted, meaningless |

The direct call is caught because `CALL_c__` demands the `FUNC` bit (`src/GAZL.cpp:337`). Everything else
accepts `ANY_FREE = NULL_PTR | FREE_ADDRESS | FUNC` (`:293`), the union - so the kind survives only while
the address is a *constant operand* and is lost the moment it is stored or computed.

## The one that does not trap

Most misuse is caught dynamically, because the two offsets are `0x44444444` apart: a data pointer used as
an ordinal underflows past `functionCount` and `CALL_VVC` rejects it (`if (ui >= functionCount) { err =
BAD_CALL; }`, `:1284-1285`). Reaching a *valid* ordinal that way would need ~4.5 GB of data.

**Arithmetic on a function pointer is the exception, and it is a silent wrong answer.** `&one + 1` is
`ordinal + 1`, which is a perfectly valid ordinal, so nothing traps - it just calls a different function.
Demonstrated by running it:

```
function one() { printInt(1); printLF(); }
function two() { printInt(2); printLF(); }
export function main() { one(); two(); }
```

with `$fp: LOCp / MOVp $fp &one / ADDp $fp $fp #1 / CALL $fp %0 *1` spliced into `main`, the program
prints:

    2 1 2

The injected call ran `two()`. No diagnostic at assembly, no trap at run time, wrong function executed.

Note this refutes the tempting summary that "misuse always traps". It does not, and the failing case is
the one a type would make unrepresentable rather than merely detectable.

## Why Impala cannot fix this alone

`impala.jspeg`'s `TYPE_SUFFIXES` maps `'F' -> 'p'`. Impala 2.0 *has* the type - named funcptr types,
`funcptr` declarations, element-type checks - and collapses it at emission because GAZL offers only `p`.
Every funcptr array and every data-pointer array emit identical `DATp` rows. The information exists and is
discarded at the boundary.

## Proposal: a fourth type, suffix `t`

`t` for "target" - the call target, which is what the ordinal actually names.

Needed (~14 table entries):

| mnemonic | why |
|---|---|
| `LOCt` | a local holding a call target |
| `MOVt` (2 forms) | assignment |
| `DATt` | initializer rows for funcptr arrays and struct fields |
| `EQUt` / `NEQt` (8 forms) | equality is meaningful - "is this the same function?" |
| `INPt` / `OUTt` | if call targets cross the host boundary |

plus `CALL_v__` accepting `t` rather than the generic `VAR_PTR_R`.

**The omissions are the feature.** There would be no `ADDt`, `SUBt`, `DIFt`, `FORt`, `LSSt`, `GRTt`,
`LEQt`, `GEQt` - roughly 30 of the 44 `p`-suffixed entries. Arithmetic and ordering on a
declaration-order ordinal are meaningless by construction, so `&one + 1` stops being a wrong answer and
becomes a line that will not assemble. That is the whole return on the change.

## Suffix letters ruled out, and why

The natural letter is `f`, and float has it. Everything else is a compromise, so record the rejects:

- **`F`** - `DATF` vs `DATf` would be two different instructions separated only by the case of the last
  letter, both legal in a data row. Mnemonics are case-sensitive (`DATI` and `dati` are both rejected),
  so it would parse - which is exactly what makes it a trap. Also breaks the convention that lowercase
  4th char = type and uppercase = word-form.
- **`a`** - collides the same way with `LOCA` / `DATA` / `PARA`.
- **`e`** - collides with `MOVE`.
- **`c`** - free and safe, but "code" has no obvious connection to a function pointer.

The lowercase suffix space is only `f i p`, plus `s` (`DATs`) and `u` (`SHRu`). `t` is free and collides
with no word-form on any stem that would take it (`MOV LOC DAT EQU NEQ INP OUT`).

## Where this is anchored, so GAZL 2 cannot miss it

A design note on its own gets missed. Every site that has to change carries a `GAZL 2:` comment pointing
back here, so the work is discovered by editing the code rather than by remembering this file:

| site | what it says |
|---|---|
| `src/GAZL.cpp`, `ANY_FREE` | SPLIT THIS - the union of `FUNC` and `FREE_ADDRESS` is the root cause |
| `src/GAZL.cpp`, `CALL_v__` / `CALL_vvs` | indirect call takes generic `VAR_PTR_R`; retype to `t` |
| `src/GAZL.cpp`, `DATp_c__` | one row can mix function and data addresses; needs a `DATt` sibling |
| `impala/impala.jspeg`, `TYPE_SUFFIXES` | `'F','p'` is where Impala discards the distinction; becomes `'F','t'` |
| `docs/gazl/InstructionSet.md`, `CALL` | the contract paragraph, plus a note that GAZL 1 cannot enforce it |
| `docs/gazl/InstructionSet.md`, `DATp` | records that `p` covers both, and why that is a problem |

**The Impala side is one map entry.** Impala already tracks funcptr as its own type `'F'` and collapses it
only at emission, so `'F','p'` -> `'F','t'` is the whole change there. Nothing else in the compiler needs
to learn a new concept - which is worth knowing before estimating the work, because the assembler side
looks like the expensive half and is.

## Open questions

- **Struct fields and `copy`.** A struct holding a call target is a mixed-type region; `DATA` rows stay
  the mixed form (see `consts.mixed` in `src/UnitTest.gazl`), so a funcptr field inside a struct
  initializer is still untyped. Whether that matters depends on how much of the win is in arrays.
- **`PEEK`/`POKE` through memory.** A word read out of memory into a `LOCt` slot is unchecked, exactly as
  a word read into `LOCi` is unchecked today. This is the existing boundary of the type system, not a new
  hole - but it means `t` is a declaration contract, not a guarantee about memory contents.
- **Host boundary.** Whether `INPt`/`OUTt` are needed at all depends on whether a host ever hands a call
  target across.
- **Migration.** `p` currently means "any pointer" in practice. Tightening it to "data pointer" is the
  breaking half; every existing funcptr use in emitted GAZL would have to move to `t`.
