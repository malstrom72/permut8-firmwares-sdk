# Coding Style and Design Principles

The canonical coding style and design principles applied across these projects - the basis for both humans and agents,
and held to in review. Each project adds its own operational notes (directory layout, build/test gates, dependencies)
in that project's `AGENTS.md` and points here for code style, so there is one source of truth to keep from drifting.
Examples below are drawn from specific projects (GAZL, NuXJS); they illustrate a rule, they are not project-scoped
exceptions to it.

## 1. Error handling, RAII, design by contract (PRIO 1)

These are the most important principles in the codebase. Get them wrong and the change will be rejected.

- **RAII means resource acquisition IS initialization.** A constructor either produces a fully valid object or throws.
  No two-phase construction. No `ok()` / `isValid()` / `init()` methods to check after the fact. No friend class that
  reaches in and fills the fields. A resource-owning class exposes no public data members.
- **Assert liberally - a lot of them.** Assertions are the primary tool for programmer errors: anything that cannot
  happen with correct code and valid inputs (a broken invariant, a precondition, an impossible case) gets an `assert`.
  Prefer the `assert(condition && "why this must hold")` form so a failure reads as an explanation. Include it as
  `#include "assert.h"` (with quotes, not `<cassert>`) so a project can override the handler with a local `assert.h`.
  Asserts are how programmer errors are handled - you never reach for `abort()`.
- **Trust the contract inward; validate only at the boundary.** A function states its preconditions and then relies on
  them. It does not re-check what a caller is contractually obligated to provide, and it does not defensively null-,
  range-, or enum-check a value the contract already pins down - it accesses it directly. Untrusted data (external
  input, a call arriving across a format/API boundary, bytes off a file, socket, or OS call) is validated exactly once,
  at the perimeter where it enters; past that line the value is known-good and code uses it as given. A guard duplicated
  inside the perimeter is not extra safety, it is dead code that hides where the real contract lives and drifts out of
  sync with it. This split - assumption-driven inside, defensive at the edges - is not optional: a defensive check on a
  contract path is a review-blocking defect, not a nicety.
- **Exceptions are for runtime conditions, not for bugs.** Throw when a failure CAN happen with correct code because of
  the environment or input (the OS refuses an executable page, allocation fails, malformed source). Never silently
  swallow such an error and never return a half-filled output or a success code on a path that did not succeed - if a
  function cannot do its job, it throws. But do NOT throw a catchable exception for a programmer error you have proven
  cannot happen: that invites the caller to build recovery around a non-condition. Assert it instead.
- **No recovery or fallback for a state that cannot happen.** Do not add an `else` that handles a case the contract
  excludes, or a fallback branch around a condition correct code cannot produce. Assert the invariant and continue as
  if it holds, because it does. A recovery path for a non-condition is untested by construction, tempts callers into
  depending on the non-condition, and launders a real bug into a silent success. This is the previous rule (never
  `throw` for a proven-impossible error) applied to branches instead of exceptions.
- **`assert` + `throw` together is transitional scaffolding, not a default.** Use it only for a bug you have not yet
  PROVEN impossible, where running past it in release would corrupt state and a real safe fallback exists - e.g. a JIT
  backend that meets an opcode it does not yet lower and falls back to the interpreter while coverage is being built.
  The throw is the release net precisely because `assert` vanishes there. Once the invariant is proven (an exhaustive
  test plus fuzzing, ideally a compile-time exhaustiveness check), remove the throw and drop to assert-only. A permanent
  hybrid advertises doubt in your own invariant.

## 2. Compactness and no duplicated functionality (PRIO 1)

- **No duplicated functionality.** Two functions or branches that do substantially the same thing are a
  defect, not a convenience: they drift apart and double every future fix. Before writing a function,
  branch, or helper, find the existing one that already does most of the job and generalize it. If you
  catch yourself writing a near-copy (a `fooArray` beside a `fooStruct`, a third size helper beside two
  others), unify them instead.
- **Compact by default.** Say it once, with the fewest moving parts. Prefer generalizing an existing path
  over adding a parallel one, and a data-driven table over repeated branches. Delete dead and superseded
  paths as you go; a change that adds a capability should still look for what it lets you remove.
- **A refactor must REDUCE size.** Its success metric is fewer lines (or fewer functions, fields,
  branches) with behavior unchanged and tests green. If a "refactor" grows the file it was the wrong
  change: reconsider the shape rather than bolting more on.
- **Do not let the data model accrete.** When a record keeps gaining a field to carry one more case,
  reshape it; a struct that has doubled its members is telling you the abstraction moved.
- **Minimizing the number of code paths is the single most important thing for correctness.** Every
  extra branch is a combination that must be reasoned about and tested; two paths that could be one are
  where bugs hide. Prefer one path that handles all cases over a special-case branch, and collapse
  branches that differ only in a value into a table or a computed operand.
- **Rewrite in three passes.** One: a prototype, thrown away. Two: the first real implementation, 100%
  working. Three: rewrite it to the fewest lines and strongest structure. Do not ship stage two - the
  experiments and the paths they left behind are the debt this section is about.
- **Optimize only for a PROVEN win.** An optimization that adds lines or code paths is allowed only when
  it buys a measured performance gain that matters. A speculative optimization is a net loss: it costs
  the one thing (code paths) most worth protecting for a benefit you have not shown.

## 3. Naming

- **No abbreviations.** Full words: `functionCount` not `fnCount`, `memory` not `mem`, `natives` not `nat`,
  `registerClass` not `regClass`. Established short domain terms that read as words are fine (`dsp`, `ip`).
- **Boolean queries are prefixed `isX()`**: `isCompiled()`, `isResident()`.
- Wrap variable, parameter, class, and function names in back-ticks inside comment text: "`weight` is the block span".

## 4. Class layout and headers

- **Hard encapsulation.** A class owns its representation and hides it completely. Data members are private; state changes
  only through methods that preserve the class invariant, which the constructor establishes (see RAII, §1). No client,
  subclass, or friend reaches past the interface to read or write internals, and there is no backdoor that fills the
  fields from outside. Expose behavior, not state: a getter/setter pair over what is really a public field is still a leak
  if it lets a caller drive the object into an invalid state. Keep implementation detail - helper types, buffers,
  bookkeeping - out of the public header so the client surface shows only what a client must call. Hard encapsulation is
  what makes RAII and design-by-contract enforceable: if the representation can only change through vetted methods, an
  inconsistent or half-built object is simply unobservable.
- **Grouped access-specifier sections, public first.** Write `public:` / `protected:` / `private:` as section headers
  on their own line (one tab in), with members indented one further tab beneath them - the NuXJS style. Do NOT prefix
  every member with its access specifier (`public:  method()` on each line): that per-declaration form is an older
  style being phased out. New code uses grouped sections; when editing an existing file, match whatever that file
  already uses.
- **No heavy headers.** Big function bodies live in a `.cpp`; only small or hot inlines belong in a header. A large
  method defined inline in a header will be moved out in review.
- **Keep the client surface minimal.** Internal helpers are not public API - make them protected members of the class
  that uses them, or namespace-internal, not part of what a client sees when they include the header.
- **C++ standard is per-repo, not a universal rule.** Match whatever standard the target repo requires. Application and
  product code is typically C++11 with some C++14; reusable libraries lean C++03 for maximum portability and stability,
  but pragmatically go to C++11 where it clearly pays (e.g. `shared_ptr`) - it is a judgement call, not dogma. (GAZL, for
  example, keeps its shipped headers and `.cpp` strict `-std=c++03`-clean - `0` not `nullptr`, `<stdint.h>` not
  `<cstdint>` - while its tools and tests use C++11.)

## 5. Comments

- **Comment sparingly - few and short.** Every comment is a maintenance liability that drifts as the code moves out
  from under it, so minimize the surface that can go stale. A comment must earn its place: the non-obvious *why*, an
  invariant, a gotcha - never the *what* (the code says that). Default to no comment. Lean on a doc `§` reference
  instead of re-explaining the design inline, and when editing prefer deleting a stale comment to updating it.
- **Multi-line block comments** use `/*` on its own line, the body indented one tab, and `*/` on its own line - single
  asterisk, tab-indented body:
  ```
  /*
  	One or more sentences. Wrap `names` in back-ticks.
  */
  ```
  Do NOT write a paragraph as a stack of `//` lines, and do NOT use decorative empty `//` banner lines.
- **Short inline comments** use a single end-of-line `//`, sitting at column 120 (the wrap column) padded with tabs -
  that is the general rule, with exceptions. A run of short related declarations may align to a common local column
  instead.
- **No Doxygen.** No `///`, no `///<`, no `/** */`, no `@param`/`@return` tags. Plain `//` and `/* */` only. (NuXJS still
  carries the old Doxygen style; it is abandoned - do not copy it.)
- **One declaration per line.**
- **Never use en or em dashes** (U+2013 and U+2014), nor any other non-ASCII lookalike (U+2011 non-breaking hyphen,
  curly quotes, U+00A0). Plain ASCII only, everywhere: code, comments, docs, and commit messages. Stick to characters
  that are on every keyboard and survive every encoding, so text stays greppable and diffs stay clean.

## 6. Formatting

- **Tabs for indentation, width 4.**
- **Opening brace on the same line** as the control statement; closing brace on its own line.
- **Control-flow bodies are always braced and never inlined.** `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do`, and `switch`
  always use `{ }` - even for a single statement - and the body goes on its own line(s), never on the control
  statement's line. The opening brace ends the control line, each body statement sits on its own indented line,
  and the closing brace is on its own line:
  ```
  if (x) {
  	blahblah;
  	duhduh;
  }
  ```
  Both a braceless body (`if (x) blahblah;`) and a one-line braced body (`if (x) { blahblah; duhduh; }`) are wrong.
  **Exception, sparingly and by agreement:** relax this only where braces clearly hurt - e.g. a flat
  lookup/dispatch table of `if (cond) return X;` rows reads better one-per-line than as dozens of braced blocks,
  and bracing there only bloats the line count for no clarity. When in doubt, brace it; take the exception only
  when it plainly wins, and confirm it in review.
- **Short inline function bodies may be a single line.** A function or method body of one or two simple statements
  may sit on one line when that reads more elegantly (`int size() const { return count; }`). This is about function
  bodies only, not the control-flow rule above - a control statement inside an inline body still follows that rule.
- **Maximum line width 120 columns.** (A trailing `//` comment may start at column 120 and run past it - see §5.)
- **`#if` / `#endif` sit one tab LEFT** of the surrounding code's indentation.
- **Break long lines by leading with the operator**, indented two tabs from the original line - the double tab marks a
  continuation, distinct from a nested block:
  ```
  someCall(veryLongFirstArgument, secondArgument, thirdArgument
  		, fourthArgument, fifthArgument)
  ```

## 7. Markdown

- **Pad table cells so the pipes line up.** Markdown renders either way; we read the source far more often than the
  rendering, so a table must be legible as plain ASCII. Pad every cell with trailing spaces to the width of its widest
  cell, and make the separator row that same width in dashes. Every row then has identical length:
  ```
  | access                          | bound                     | enforced                         |
  | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `%N`, `$x` (fixed offset)       | `localsSize + paramsSize` | once, at `FUNC` entry (cpp:1273) |
  | `SETL` / `GETL` (dynamic index) | `dataStackEnd`            | every access (cpp:1312-1313)     |
  ```
  Tables obey the 120-column limit like everything else. If padding pushes past it, shorten the cells - abbreviate,
  or move an aside into prose under the table - do not let the table sprawl.
- **ASCII diagrams must actually align.** Count the columns; a caret or arrow that misses its target by one is worse
  than no diagram. Generate the marker lines rather than eyeballing them.
