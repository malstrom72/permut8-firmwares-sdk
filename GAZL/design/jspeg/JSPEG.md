# JSPEG

JSPEG is the JavaScript PEG generator that powers the Impala compiler. A grammar is a list of
rules written in PEG syntax - ordered choice, greedy repetition, syntactic predicates - where any
expression can carry an inline JavaScript action, plus tags and captures for naming values.
`jspeg.jspeg` compiles a grammar into a single self-contained parser function.

## Current Status

- Self-hosting: `jspeg.jspeg` compiles to `jspegCompiler.js`, and the self-hosted compiler reproduces identical output.
- Impala compiler: `impala.jspeg` compiles to `impalaCompiler.js`; parity checks pass against recorded output.
- Regression suite: arithmetic and tag/capture grammars match across baseline and self-hosted compilers; Impala parity fixtures match expected `.gazl` outputs; compiler state recovers after aborted compiles.

## Repository Layout

Core JSPEG files live in `impala/`:

- `jspeg.jspeg` - self-hosting grammar that yields the JSPEG compiler function `compileJSPEG`.
- `jspegCompiler.js` - checked-in compiler output for `jspeg.jspeg` (CommonJS export).
- `jspegCompilerTests.js` - self-hosting and grammar equivalence tests for JSPEG.
- `updateJSPEG.js` - regenerates or verifies compiler outputs; runs the JSPEG regression suite.

Impala-on-JS (the compiler generated from `impala.jspeg`) has its own usage and tooling. See `design/jspeg/ImpalaJS.md` for those details (CLI, programmatic API, and parity tests).

## Quickstart (JSPEG)

Compile a small grammar and run the resulting parser inside Node.js using the checked-in JSPEG compiler:

```bash
node - <<'NODE'
const path = require('path');
const dir = path.join(__dirname, 'impala');

// Load the JSPEG compiler (CommonJS function export)
const compileJSPEG = require(path.join(dir, 'jspegCompiler.js'));

// Toy grammar: one digit '+' one digit
const grammar = 'root <- a=[0-9] \'+\' b=[0-9] { $$ = (+$a) + (+$b); }\n';
const [ok, generated, index] = compileJSPEG(grammar);
if (!ok || index !== grammar.length) throw new Error('compile failed');

let parse; eval('parse=' + generated);
console.log(parse('4+7'));
NODE
```

If wired correctly, it prints `[ true, 11, 3 ]`.

## Parser Interface

Generated parsers return `[ success, value, endIndex ]`. Parsing starts at the rule named
`root`, so every grammar needs one.

## `$$`, Tags, And Captures

`$$` is the value a rule produces. Inside an action it is an ordinary variable: read it, assign
it, mutate its fields. A rule matches or it does not - that is the boolean the parser tracks -
and `$$` is what it leaves behind when it does.

- **Sub-rules share your `$$`.** Reference a rule without a tag and it works on the same value
  you do, so whatever it leaves is what you see next. A rule with no action of its own therefore
  passes its sub-rule's value straight up.

- **`name: expr` (tag)** runs `expr` against a *fresh* value, then puts the result in `$name` and
  leaves your `$$` untouched. Use it when you need a sub-rule's value as well as your own.

- **`name = expr` (capture)** puts the *matched text* in `$name`. `$$ = expr` captures the text
  into `$$` itself.

- **`&expr` and `!expr` (predicates)** test whether `expr` matches at this point *without consuming
  input* - `&` succeeds when it matches, `!` when it does not. They leave `$$` exactly as they
  found it, so you can look ahead with a rule that assigns `$$` and keep your own value.

- **`$name` is the value.** `$name.field` is a field on it. Both mean exactly what they look like.

### A failed alternative keeps what its actions did

When an alternative fails partway, the input position rewinds to where that alternative started -
but anything its actions already did to `$$` stands. This is deliberate, and grammars rely on it to
hoist a shared initializer out of parallel alternatives:

```
Literal  <-              { $$ = '' }
            ['] ( !['] c:Char { $$ += $c } )* ['] Spacing
          / ["] ( !["] c:Char { $$ += $c } )* ["] Spacing
```

`{ $$ = '' }` sits in the first alternative, before the quote character that decides which branch
matches. On a double-quoted literal the first branch fails immediately after that action - and the
second branch runs with `$$` already `''`, which is exactly what it needs. Write the second branch
assuming a fresh `$$` and it will append to whatever the caller left there instead.

Predicates are the exception: they restore `$$`, because they consume nothing.

Also available inside an action: `$$s` (the whole source string) and `$$i` (the current index).

A `$$parser.` prefix is erased by the compiler, so `$$parser.foo` and `foo` name the same closure
local - there is no parser object to reach at run time. The prefix is a readability convention for
the helpers a grammar defines in its prelude, and it only works with a dot: bare `$$parser` compiles
to nonsense.

### Examples

Build a record from key/value pairs - `$$` is the record, `$key`/`$val` are the captured text:

```
pair <- key=ident ':' _ val=number  { $$[$key] = $val }
```

Accumulate - `$$` carries the running total across the loop. Parsing `"1 2 3"` gives `6`:

```
root <- { $$ = 0 } ( _ n=[0-9]+ { $$ += +$n } )* _ !.
```

Take a sub-rule's value while keeping your own - `$t` gets `TypeBase`'s value, `$$` stays yours:

```
VarDecl <- { $$ = {} } t:TypeBase id:Identifier  { $$.type = $t; $$.name = $id }
```

### How it is implemented

Enough to read the generated file or debug a miscompile:

- A rule compiles to `function Rule()` - no parameters - returning `true`/`false` for match.
- `$$` compiles to `_val`, one module-level variable; `$$.field` to `_val.field`. That is why an
  untagged sub-rule shares your value: it is literally the same variable.
- A tag saves `_val`, gives the sub-rule a fresh slot, then restores - on failure as well as
  success, since an alternative that fails rewinds `_i` but deliberately not `_val` (above).
- `&`/`!` compile to a wrapper that saves both `_i` and `_val` and puts both back.
- `$$s`/`$$i` compile to `_s`/`_i`.

## Authoring Hazards

The rewriter is textual and its rules are positional, so several mistakes produce *silently wrong
JavaScript* rather than a grammar error. These are the ones that have actually cost time; each is
verifiable from `impala/jspeg.jspeg` and from the generated `impalaCompiler.js`.

- **Comment syntax depends on where you are.** At grammar level (between rules, between terms)
  comments are `#`-to-end-of-line only - `Comment <- '#' (!EndOfLine .)* …`.
  A `/* … */` there is a syntax error, and `updateJSPEG.js` reports it as a byte *index* into the
  grammar with no line number. Inside an action block, `/* */` and `//` are both fine (`PikaComment`).
- **The action rewriter walks into `/* */` comments.** It special-cases `//` (copied verbatim to the
  newline) but never `/*`, so `$` tokens inside a block comment are
  rewritten and its line breaks are collapsed. A real example from `impala.jspeg`'s `VarDecl`: the
  source comment says “an end-of-rule `$$i`” and the generated file says “an end-of-rule `_i`”. Prose
  about `$$`/`$$i`/`$name` is safest in a `#` comment above the rule, or in a `//` comment.
- **Actions must stay inside the JavaScript subset NuXJS supports.** The generated compiler runs
  under NuXJS as well as Node, so an action cannot use a builtin just because the local Node has it.
  `Array.prototype.map` is absent, for one. Reach for the prelude helpers instead: `iterate` for
  array walks, `map` for building a table, `replace` for replace-all, `find`/`span`/`rspan` for
  character scanning. `nuxjsParityTests.js` compiles the same programs under both engines and
  byte-compares, so a slip here fails the gate rather than the user.
- **In a character class, `-` binds as a range even before `]`** - `[+-]` is a range from `+` to
  the class terminator, not "plus or minus" (regex habits do not apply; `Range <- Char '-' Char`
  follows Ford's PEG). The compiler refuses the unescaped spelling with a line:column diagnostic.
  Write `[-+]` for a literal dash, or escape the endpoint - `[+-\]]` - if you really mean a range
  ending at `]`.
- **Never declare `_val`, `_s`, `_im` or `_i` in an action.** An action body is wrapped in
  `(function(){ … })()`, so a `var` of one of those names shadows the parser variable that `$$`,
  `$$s` and `$$i` compile to, and the failure would be a *silent miscompile*: the action writes its
  own local, the register keeps a stale value, and nothing errors. `updateJSPEG.js` refuses the
  declaration at regeneration rather than letting it reach the byte-compare gate.
- **A rule that builds a record must initialize it.** `$$.count = 0` needs `$$` to already be an
  object. Value rules that act as containers start with `$$ = {}` (see `TypeDeclr`, `VarDecl`,
  `ArrayDecl`, `ExternDecl` in `impala.jspeg`).
- **Reuse a declarator rule rather than adding one, but check its fields first.** `TypeDeclr`
  (name optional) and `VarDecl` (name required) cover both declarator shapes. They look
  interchangeable and are not: `words` differs for a funcptr type - `TypeDeclr` sets 1, `VarDecl`
  leaves it undefined - and forcing them to agree reds four goldens. Pick the rule whose fields the
  call site actually reads - the extern-return site reads only
  `type`/`elem`/`struct`, which is why `TypeDeclr` is safe there.

## Regenerating Compilers

Use `updateJSPEG.js` to keep generated artifacts in sync with their grammars. It also runs the JSPEG regression suite.

```bash
# From anywhere
node impala/updateJSPEG.js          # rebuild jspegCompiler.js and impalaCompiler.js
node impala/updateJSPEG.js --check  # verify checked-in files are current
```

`--check` is CI-friendly: it does not rewrite files and exits non-zero if regeneration is needed. After regeneration (or `--check`), tests run automatically inside the script.

You can also run the full repository build and regression tests:

```bash
timeout 180 ./build.sh
```

## Using the Impala Compiler (JS)

For using the JavaScript Impala compiler (CLI, API, and tests), see `design/jspeg/ImpalaJS.md`.

## Running the JSPEG Tests

- `node jspegCompilerTests.js` - verifies `jspegCompiler.js` matches `jspeg.jspeg`, and that a self-hosted compile reproduces identical output.

Impala parity tests and the Impala CLI are documented in `ImpalaJS.md`.
