## Problem 1: Actions run during backtracking - side effects don't undo

### Mechanics

`Sequence` backtracks by restoring the input position only:

```js
p1 && p2 && ... || (_im = (_i > _im ? _i : _im), _i = _b, false)
```

Any action that already ran keeps its effects. Worse, `&`/`!` predicates *evaluate actions too* -
the `Prefix` codegen runs the captured expression (actions included) and restores `_i` and the
value register, but has no way to undo an action's `$$parser` side effects. Since the Impala
compiler emits code and mutates symbol tables *from actions*, a speculative parse would emit
phantom code.

`impala.jspeg` avoids hitting this at every backtrack point only because its actions are hand-placed
at **sequence ends** - they fire after an alternative has committed, so ordered-choice / `?` / `*`
backtracking unwinds *before* any action runs. That discipline breaks in exactly two spots, patched
two different ways:

1. **The `Comp` `!Group` probe** (deciding whether a parenthesized thing is a boolean group or an
   expression) - a predicate *forces* its sub-parse's actions to run and then discards them. Handled
   by a hand-rolled transaction flag: the probe sets `$$parser.dry` and **22 `if (!$$parser.dry)`
   guards** spread across the grammar serve it, plus one inverse guard in the prelude.
2. **The `FuncCall` prologue**, which borrows the call window *before* parsing the arguments - a
   mid-sequence effect that cannot sit at the end, so it cannot use `dry` (the borrow must really
   happen for the wet parse). Patched instead by **hard-failing** (E442) rather than allowing a
   backtrack out of a half-borrowed call.

So the grammar already carries **two** speculation mechanisms plus a positional convention holding the
rest together. Costs of the `dry` half: every new action must remember its guard (silent corruption
when forgotten), and every parenthesized condition is parsed twice (once dry, once wet).

### What it would take

The framing that matters: `dry`, and every variant of it, **manages** speculation inside an emit-now
model - and PEG speculates pervasively, so that is whack-a-mole. `FuncCall` was already a second mole,
patched differently from the first. Two of the options below only manage; **only the last removes the
problem.**

- **Does not generalize - automate `dry`, or swap the receiver.** Two tempting shortcuts, both dead
  ends, for the same reason. *(a) Automate `dry` in the codegen:* the generator wraps every action in
  an implicit `if (!_dry)` and predicates set/restore `_dry` - deletes the ~16 guards, but teaches the
  PEG *code generator* Impala's dry/wet semantics (the wrong layer), and still only covers the "don't
  run it" case. *(b) Swap the receiving object to a no-op twin* while a probe runs (route all effects
  through one `sb`, point it at a do-nothing board during speculation) - keeps the generator
  semantics-free, but covers even less. Both only answer **"don't perform it"** (the predicate case).
  Neither answers **"already performed it, now undo it"** - which is what ordered-choice / `?` / `*`
  backtracking needs, and which is the *majority* of PEG speculation. By the time such an alternative
  fails, the effect already happened, so a no-op board is unreachable. This is `FuncCall` restated:
  there the borrow must really happen, so no-op is useless and the grammar hard-fails instead of
  undoing.
- **Generalizes, but IS two-phase - a recording board.** The seam in (b) is right; the *twin* is
  wrong. Swap to a board that does not emit but **buffers** each effect into the current rule,
  discarding the buffer on backtrack and flushing it to the parent on commit - that covers all
  speculation uniformly. But an action that appends to a per-rule buffer instead of emitting, thrown
  away if the rule fails, is two-phase in miniature. So this is not a separate option; it is the
  incremental on-ramp to the one below. *Precondition either way, verified 2026-08-11: `$$parser.x`
  FLATTENS to bare closure locals (`var $$parser = {}` is a near-empty shell; `dry`/`binaryOp`/
  `symbols`/`metacode` all generate as plain locals inside the compiler function), so there is no
  object to swap or buffer on today - step 0 is moving parser state onto a real object, the same "thin
  the fat inline actions into `$$parser`" surface `RefactorPlan.md` and collect mode already want.*
- **Removes the problem - two-phase compilation (parse → AST → emit).** The only option where
  **nothing observable happens until a rule commits.** Actions become pure node
  constructors; a separate walk emits GAZL. Backtracking discards half-built nodes (garbage), so
  the side-effect problem ceases to exist rather than being managed - both `dry` and the `FuncCall`
  hard-fail dissolve, because the borrow and the emit move to the walk, after the parse succeeded.
  This also unlocks: multi-error
  diagnostics, free lookahead for new syntax (destructuring `x, y = f()` vs expression statement),
  and Impala 2.0's `import` interface mode (parse, take declarations, emit nothing) as a trivial
  variant instead of a special mode. *That last one is a convenience, **not** a dependency: import
  cycles need only declaration-level two-phase, which `design/impala/Impala2Slices.md:155-163` scopes as a
  mode on `$$parser` and explicitly separates from this rework. Do not wait for it to fix cycles.*
  *Impact on `impala.jspeg`: rule structure unchanged; every action rewritten from emit-now to
  build-node. Note this is **not** a change to JSPEG - nothing in the code generator stops a grammar
  from building nodes in its actions today, so it is a rewrite of `impala.jspeg` and sits with the
  grammar author alone. It pairs well with the value model (Problem 2), which makes a node simply the value
  a rule returns, but neither waits for the other.*

## Problem 2: The `._` holder duality - **SOLVED (2026-08-28)**

Full record: [`ValueModel.md`](ValueModel.md). Summary of what landed, since the design below is
no longer the plan of record:

- `$$` **is** the value register (`_val`). No holder objects, no `._` convention, no rewriter
  heuristics - so action text no longer depends on distant grammar context, which was the whole
  complaint. Rules are param-less and still return a boolean for match/no-match.
- Both grammars were migrated (`impala.jspeg` 110 rules, `jspeg.jspeg` 40), every step
  **byte-identical** against the golden corpus, plus NuXJS parity and the fuzzer.
- The `$$.` holder-escape sites this section counted at ~126 did not need a mechanical migration:
  `$$.field` simply became `_val.field`. What *did* need hand edits was small - three explicit
  `._` derefs, and author locals whose names collided with the register.

Two things the design below got wrong, worth keeping because they cost time:

- **"tags become plain local variables"** is true, but a tag is also the *only* construct that
  touches the register non-locally: it must seed the register with its own slot and restore the
  parent's - on failure as well as success, because PEG backtracking rewinds the input cursor and
  not the register.
- **A per-rule value local plus a publish step does not work.** It survives only while values are
  *mutated*; a grammar whose values are *replaced* (strings - i.e. `jspeg.jspeg` itself) reads a
  stale copy. Having `$$` be the register directly is what removes the failure mode.

The pairing with Problem 1 noted above still holds and is still optional: in two-phase style `$$`
is just the node under construction.

## Problem 3: Performance

### Mechanics

Three costs, all in the codegen: char classes compile to `indexOf` over expanded strings (`[a-z]`
becomes a 26-character string scanned linearly per test), captures allocate a value slot per rule
invocation whether or not the alternative holding them matches, and every expression, prefix,
repetition and action is wrapped in an IIFE. One generated rule as exhibit - four IIFEs and two
slot allocations per invocation, before the body does any work:

```js
function Bitwise(){var $first,$op=newMetaSlot(),_sv$op,$r=newMetaSlot(),_sv$r;
  return (function(){var _b=_i;return (function(){ $first = undefined; ; return true})()&&AddSub()
  &&((function(){while((function(){...})());})(),true)||(_im=(_i>_im?_i:_im),_i=_b,false)})()};
```

**Measured reality check:** under Node (V8 JIT), this is already fast - `calc.impala` (676 lines)
compiles in ~100 ms and `chess.impala` (1442 lines) in ~155 ms *including* interpreter startup.
The pain is specifically the **NuXJS interpreter path** (the zero-dependency toolchain the build
ships), where closure-per-step codegen is paid at full price - that path is the reason the demo
calls the compiler "slow, a prototype". The double-parse of every condition (Problem 1) also
taxes both paths.

### What it would take

- **Codegen-only, parity-gated, zero grammar changes:**
  - Statement-style output instead of IIFEs - success flags plus labeled breaks; no closure
    allocation per parse step. Biggest single win on NuXJS.
  - Char classes as range comparisons (`c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'`) or per-class lookup tables.
  - Allocate a capture's value slot lazily - only when that alternative actually matches. About 57%
    of the slots a rule allocates per invocation are never seeded by any capture.
- **Pragmatic immediately:** bless `impala/impala.node.js` as the development-loop compiler (it
  already exists and is fast); keep NuXJS as the dependency-free distribution path.
- Packrat memoization is *not* recommended - Impala's grammar is nearly deterministic and the
  measured costs are constant-factor, not asymptotic.

## Adjacent gap: syntax-error quality

Not one of the three, but the Impala 2.0 diagnostics contract (`docs/impala/Impala2.md`, "Diagnostics")
depends on it. Today a failed parse returns only the farthest-failure offset (`_im`) - no expected
tokens, no rule context. Semantic errors via `$$parser.fail` are fine; *parse* errors are not, and
agents writing new 2.0 syntax will hit parse errors constantly.

**What it would take:** collect an expected-set at the failure frontier - terminals that fail while
`_i === _im` push a short description; the runner formats `path:line:col: error[E###]: expected
X, Y, or Z` (offset→line:col mapping is runner-side and trivial). Token rules get display names.
Modest codegen change, no grammar changes, and it can land before any Impala 2.0 work.

## Adjacent gap: the PikaScript emulation layer - DONE (2026-08-29)

The shim is gone: `bake` (an `eval` on error text whose brace interpolation never actually fired -
`typeError` substitutes before calling `fail`), the dead `args`/queue wrappers, and the
`evaluate`/`resetQueue`/`floor`/`random`/`time` aliases were deleted or inlined. `noop` stays: it is
passed by name into the `UNARY_OPS` table. What remains in the prelude is not a shim - `replace`
(global replace, shorter than `split`/`join` at 11 sites), `char`/`ordinal` (a `& 0xFF` mask over
`fromCharCode`/`charCodeAt`), `find`/`span`/`rspan` (character scanning), and `map`/`iterate`
(NuXJS-safe table building and array walks).

One deviation from the plan as written: E438 keeps its `{`->`(` row mangling. With `bake` gone the
swap is no longer a defence, but a struct row still reads better unbraced in a one-line message, so
it stays as a formatting choice.

## Sequencing

**Nothing here gates Impala 2.0 Step 1.** Step 1 (typed declarations) and the strict-expression
rules need zero JSPEG changes - they are additive grammar work in the existing style. The groups
below express *pairing and deadlines*, not prerequisites; every item is gated only by the parity
fixtures.

| When | Work | `impala.jspeg` impact | Ordering constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Any time, independent | Expected-set error reporting; finish `RefactorPlan.md` return-style helpers (the PikaScript emulation shim is retired - see the DONE section above) | none / mechanical | error reporting should exist by the time 2.0 *ships* (Diagnostics contract); none blocks Step 1 |
| Before Steps 4/5, *if adopted* | Retire the speculation patches (`dry` + the `FuncCall` hard-fail) - flag/receiver tricks only *manage* it and don't generalize (see Problem 1); the general fix is two-phase, whose on-ramp is a recording board (needs state on a real object first, a superset of `RefactorPlan`); de-IIFE + char-class codegen | rule structure unchanged; actions move from emit-now to build-node | destructuring lookahead and import interface mode are the two features that lean on the side-effect weakness - the only real ordering edge in this document |
| ~~Done 2026-08-28~~ | ~~Value-returning rules~~ - `$$` is the value register; see Problem 2 and [`ValueModel.md`](ValueModel.md) | byte-identical migration of both grammars | was optional; landed early |
| Independent of JSPEG entirely | Two-phase AST in `impala.jspeg` (actions build nodes, a walk emits) | rules unchanged; every action rewritten as a node constructor | not a JSPEG change at all - possible today; convenient to do alongside it, not gated on it |

The closing point from the Impala 2.0 review bears repeating: JSPEG's parity discipline is its best
feature, because it makes every one of these changes - up to and including a full replacement of
the code generator - cheap to verify. The fixtures are the spec.
