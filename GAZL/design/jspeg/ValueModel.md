# JSPEG's Value Model - design and migration record

Status: **DONE (2026-08-28).** How `$$` came to be the value register. The end-state named in
[`JSPEGFuture.md`](JSPEGFuture.md) Problem 2: the one breaking change to the JSPEG code generator itself, and
it is about `$$`/holders, nothing else. It is independent of the two-phase AST rework (Problem 1) and of the
`$$parser`-state-on-an-object step; none of them gate this one.

## What is being removed

Today every generated rule is `function Rule($){ … }` where `$` is a **holder object** and the rule's value
is `$._`. Two mechanisms sit on that, both in [`impala/jspegCompiler.js`](../../impala/jspegCompiler.js) (the
generated generator) and defined in [`impala/jspeg.jspeg`](../../impala/jspeg.jspeg):

- **Tag holders.** `$x:Rule` allocates a fresh holder - `Tagged` emits `($t.vr=$.vr)[$v._]='={}'`, so `$x`
  becomes `$x={}` and its value is `$x._`. `Definition` then declares `var $x={},…` at the top of the rule.
- **The `._` rewriter heuristics** in `Action`: `$$`→`$._`, `$$.`→the holder object, and bare `$name`→
  `$name._` *unless* the name is not a holder or is immediately followed by `.`. The consequence, and the reason
  this is worth removing, is that **the meaning of `$name` in an action depends on distant grammar context**
  (whether that name was ever introduced as a tag) - the "holder/value duality."

Dropping the container means: a rule *produces* its value, tags become **plain local variables**, `$$` becomes
an **ordinary variable**, and the `._` heuristics plus the `={}` holder allocation are deleted from the
generator. Object-valued results still support field mutation (`$$.count = 0` on a plain object), so
container-style rules (e.g. `FuncCall`) migrate by initializing `$$ = {…}` instead of relying on a pre-existing
holder.

## The load-bearing design question (settle in M1 before anything else)

The current model carries **two** channels: the rule's boolean return is *parse success*; the value rides
*out of band* in the caller's holder (`$._`). Value-returning rules collapse the value channel into the return
- which forces a decision about how *success* is then signalled, because the sequence/choice combinators are
built on `&&`/`||` over booleans (`p1 && p2 && … || (backtrack)`) and you cannot `&&` values.

Candidate protocols, to be chosen and prototyped in M1:

- **FAIL sentinel.** A rule returns its value on success and a module-level `FAIL` object on failure;
  combinators become `v = Sub(); if (v === FAIL) backtrack`. Clean, but every rule site tests the sentinel and
  "matched and produced `FAIL`-shaped value" must be impossible by construction.
- **Boolean return + assigned value var.** Keep the boolean combinator chain exactly as today, but replace the
  holder with a plain local the action assigns and the rule returns via a trailing slot the generator threads.
  Smallest diff to the combinator codegen; the question is where the returned value is stashed without a holder.
- **Position-delta success + value return.** Success = `_i` advanced / no error flag set; value = the return.
  Decouples the two channels entirely but changes how zero-width matches report success.

M1's job is to pick one, prove it on the self-grammar, and record why. Everything downstream assumes the choice.

## M1 findings (2026-08-28): the holder's dual role, and why the self-grammar is the *hard* case

Reading the generator source surfaced a subtlety Problem 2 understates: the holder `$` carries **two** channels,
not one.

- **Upward - the value.** `$._` is the rule's semantic result. This is the channel this change is about.
- **Downward - scope context.** In the self-grammar, `Definition` sets `$$.tag/vi/vr` and the `Expression`
  sub-rule *reads them back* from the same holder it is handed (pre-migration `jspeg.jspeg`) -
  the holder is threaded *down* to pass the current variable-numbering scope into nested expressions.

Measured on the two grammars (2026-08-28):

- **`impala.jspeg` (the real target) uses only the upward channel.** Zero `$tag.field = $$.field` downward-copy
  sites; every `$$.field` is result-record building (`$$.words`, `$$.retSlots`, `$$.elems`, `$$.type`, …), and
  all cross-rule state lives on `$$parser.*` globals (`fail`×87, `emit`×70, `metacode`, `symbols`, `declare`,
  `newLabel`, `counters`, …). So `$$` there is a plain bottom-up record and nothing is threaded through holders.
- **Only the self-grammar threads context down** (`vi/tag/vr`). It is therefore the *atypical, hard* case - the
  opposite of the plan's original "prototype on the self-grammar first (easy)" assumption.

**Consequence for the protocol.** Split the holder's two roles instead of collapsing them:

- **`$$` becomes the value** - a plain rule-local, object-valued where used as a container (initialize `$$ = {}`
  before the first `$$.field =`), scalar otherwise. It flows *up* via a shared return register (`_val`): a rule
  keeps its boolean combinator return (so the `&&`/`||` chains are unchanged) and sets `_val` to its result;
  tags capture `_val` **eagerly** in the same `&&` step as the call (`Sub() && ($x = _val, true)`), so the single
  register is never clobbered before capture. This deletes holder allocation and the `._` convention.
- **`$` (single) becomes the downward context param**, kept only for rules that thread scope. In a migrated
  self-grammar the `vi/tag/vr` uses move from `$$.` to `$.`; **`impala.jspeg` needs none of this**, so its
  migration is uniform and mechanical.

**The passthrough refinement (found stress-testing `_val` against `jspegTest.jspeg`).** A shared register has a
clobbering hazard the holder model does not: in a passthrough rule like `group <- number _ / '(' _ expr ')' _`,
`number` sets the value but the trailing `_` (whitespace, no action) runs *after* it. With a naive
"set `_val = $$` at every rule end," `_`'s call would overwrite `_val` with junk and `group` would lose
`number`'s value. The holder model is immune because `number` and `_` share `group`'s one holder and only
`number` writes it. Resolution, and the precise emission rule:

> A rule sets `_val` **only if it assigns `$$`** (via an action, a `$$:` tag, or a `$$=` capture). Value-less
> rules (`_`, pure token rules) leave `_val` exactly as their sub-calls left it. So `_val` is touched only by
> value-producing rules, and passthrough works: after `number() && _()`, `_val` still holds `number`'s value,
> and a `group` with no `$$` action forwards it untouched.

The generator must therefore track a per-rule "assigns `$$`" flag (a small addition alongside the existing
`vars` tracking) and emit the trailing `&& (_val = $$, true)` conditionally.

**Protocol empirically validated (2026-08-28).** [`valueReturningProto.js`](valueReturningProto.js) is a
hand-generated value-returning parser for `jspegTest.jspeg` (built by applying the emission rules above by hand)
that passes all 9 arithmetic cases - passthrough (`root`, `group`), the accumulator loops (a tagged sub-call
sets `_val` but does **not** clobber the parent's `$$` local), operator precedence, parens, whitespace, and
division. So the `_val`-register model computes correctly end to end; what remains for M1 is making the
*generator* emit this shape (not whether the shape is right).

This is the working decision.

## M1 emission prototype - WORKS, and it found the migration's real boundary (2026-08-28)

The value-returning *generator* is prototyped in a throwaway generator (since deleted - see Artifact cleanup) (a copy of
`jspeg.jspeg` with ~7 emission actions rewritten). Driven meta-circularly - current `compileJSPEG` compiles
that prototype into a new-emission generator, which compiles `jspegTest.jspeg` - it produces exactly the target
shape (param-less rules, `var _v` value locals, eager `($x=_val,true)` captures, a conditional
`&&(_val=_v,true)` suffix, **no holders, no `._`**) and **passes all 9 arithmetic cases**. The generator surgery
is real, not hand-waved. Two hazards from the M1 note were handled cleanly:

- **The string-literal `$` hazard** (the rewriter processes `$` even inside emitted string literals - it is why
  the old `Definition` carries a stray `var $` from its `'($){'` literal): dodged by naming the value local `_v`
  (no `$`) and going **param-less** in the prototype (rule refs emit `ID()`, no `$` literal anywhere).
- The generator's own actions stay holder-style (interpreted by the current compiler); only the emitted strings
  changed - so the bootstrap is clean.

**The boundary it found - the shared-downward-container idiom does NOT survive.** `tagCaptureTest.jspeg` builds a
map with `root <- _ {$$={}} pair …` where the untagged `pair` does `$$[$key]=$value` **expecting `$$` to be
root's map** (holder model: `pair` shares root's holder). Under value-returning, generated `pair()` gets its own
`var _v` and writes `_v[$key]` on an *uninitialized* local - it crashes, and even if it didn't it would fill the
wrong object. So a rule that mutates an **inherited** `$$` container via an untagged call is not mechanically
migratable; such grammars must be rewritten (sub-rule *returns* a value, parent merges) or use an explicit
accumulator (a `$$parser` global). This is exactly the kind of thing M3's "tag rebinding / container audit" must
catch, now with a concrete failure signature to grep for.

**Does `impala.jspeg` (the real target) use that idiom? - inconclusive, audit required.** Counts: 20 `$$ =`
initializations vs 75 `$$.field`/`+=` writes. That ratio fits *either* "init once, write many fields locally"
(safe) *or* some rules writing an inherited `$$` (unsafe). The dominant patterns - per-rule `makeMeta` records
and `$$parser.*` globals for accumulation (`emit`, `metacode`, `symbols`) - lean strongly toward local records +
global accumulation (safe), but this must be **proven per-rule in M3** before the migration is declared
mechanical. The go/no-go for the whole refactor rests here: if impala.jspeg avoids the inherited-container idiom,
the migration is uniform; if a few rules use it, they get the return-and-merge rewrite.

**Generator self-hosting** remains its own step (regenerating `jspegCompiler.js` with the new emission requires
the self-grammar's downward-`vi/tag/vr` context to move onto the `$` param) - isolated to the generator, not to
`impala.jspeg`.

## Go/no-go audit result (2026-08-28): NOT uniform - the postfix-chain/accumulator cluster is the real work

The audit (`auditContainer.js`: per-rule, flag any rule that mutates `$$` as a container without a direct init)
found **6 of 93 rules** using the pattern: `TypeDeclr`, `ExternDecl`, `VarDecl`, `ArrayDecl`, `FuncCall`,
`Argument`. Inspecting the two load-bearing ones settles the question - **the answer is that `impala.jspeg` DOES
use the inherited-container idiom**, in its call machinery:

- **`FuncCall`** receives `$$` = the *callee's* meta record (built earlier in the postfix chain, the documented
  "`$` shared by uncaptured sub-rules" pattern) and adds `.count/.retSlots/.words/.base/.types/.elems/…` to it.
  It never inits `$$` because `$$` is inherited - so the JSPEGFuture claim "FuncCall migrates by initializing
  `$$ = {}`" is **wrong**: that would destroy the inherited callee record.
- **`Argument`** (referenced untagged ×4 inside `FuncCall`) accumulates into that shared `$$`: `++$$.count`,
  `$$.types.push(meta.type)`, `$$.words += w`. This is exactly the tagCaptureTest crash pattern - an untagged
  child mutating the parent's container.

So dropping the `$` container is **not** a mechanical migration of 125 sites. There is a **hard core**: the
postfix-chain expression builder plus the call/declaration accumulators (the 6 rules above, at least
`FuncCall`+`Argument` confirmed as inherited-accumulators; the declaration rules - some referenced tagged, e.g.
`v:VarDecl`, `out:TypeDeclr` - need per-rule triage into "self-container, add init = easy" vs
"inherited-accumulator = rewrite"). These rules keep a *mutable record threaded across sibling rules*, which the
per-rule-`_v` model does not provide.

**This is the real design decision the refactor turns on** - how to carry that threaded record without the
holder. Options (to weigh before M3):

1. **Explicit accumulator off `$$`.** Move the call/decl record onto `$$parser` state (a small stack of
   in-progress records), the way impala.jspeg already accumulates emitted code via `$$parser.emit`/`metacode`.
   The postfix chain pushes/reads the current record; `$$` stays a plain value. Most in keeping with the
   codebase's existing "state lives on `$$parser`" style; the tradeoff is a manual push/pop discipline.
2. **Return-and-merge.** `Argument` *returns* its `{type, elem, words, …}` contribution; `FuncCall` folds the
   list. Purely functional, no shared state, but a larger rewrite of the argument loop and the close-of-call
   checks that currently read the accumulated fields.
3. **A context object threaded down the chain** (the `$` param this plan already reserves for the self-grammar's
   scope) - carry the in-progress record on `$` for exactly these rules. Smallest diff to the existing actions,
   but reintroduces a downward container for one cluster (a scoped, honest version of what we're removing).

Recommendation leans (1): it matches how impala.jspeg already threads cross-rule state and keeps `$$` a pure
value everywhere. The choice gates M3; the other ~119 sites remain the mechanical migration the plan assumed.

### DECISION (2026-08-28): return-and-merge (option 2) for the hard core - superseded: the hard core later landed as pure arrow flips (see M3 COMPLETE)

`Argument` *returns* its contribution instead of mutating a shared record; `FuncCall` folds the list. No shared
mutable state - `$$` is a pure value everywhere, the strongest end-state. Concrete shape:

- **`Argument`** returns a record `{ meta: $a, type, elem, opnd, structWords }` (structWords = 1 for a scalar,
  `structWords(struct)` for a by-value struct) and does **not** place the value or touch a shared `$$`. The
  `E406`/index-use checks it does today stay in `Argument` (they are per-arg and need no window offset).
- **`FuncCall`** collects the returned records into a local array (the `(Argument (','_ Argument)*)?` loop tags
  each and pushes), then **after the loop folds once**: `words = 0; for each arg { winSlot = base + retSlots +
  words; place(arg) /* makeArgValue or copyStructArg at winSlot */; words += arg.structWords; }`, then runs the
  existing count/type/signature checks against the collected list and closes the call. `$$` for `FuncCall` stays
  the inherited callee meta; the accumulation lives in locals.

**The load-bearing risk is emission ORDER.** Today placement (`makeArgValue`/`copyStructArg`, which *emit*)
happens *during* the argument loop; return-and-merge moves it into the post-loop fold. The fold must emit in the
same left-to-right arg order so the generated `.gazl` is **byte-identical** - the corpus parity gate is the
proof. Two things to verify when it lands: (a) the by-value-struct `svals` LAST-door check at close still sees
the same list, and (b) the scratch-pool ownership of each `$a` survives being held in the array until the fold
(see the `<X>` scratch-ownership note in memory) - i.e. the args' meta slots must not be released until placement.

`Argument`+`FuncCall` are the confirmed inherited-accumulators. The four declaration rules (`TypeDeclr`,
`ExternDecl`, `VarDecl`, `ArrayDecl`) get the M3 triage: a tagged-only, self-contained record just gains a
`$$ = {}` init (mechanical); any that accumulate across an untagged call get the same return-and-merge treatment.

## Status after M1 (2026-08-28)

M1 is effectively complete: protocol decided **and** validated (hand-parser + real generator, `jspegTest` 9/9),
value-returning generator prototyped, the migration boundary found and the go/no-go answered
(not uniform; hard core identified), and the hard-core strategy chosen (return-and-merge).

## M3 triage complete (2026-08-28)

**A key mechanics correction confirmed during triage:** `$$.field` maps to `$.field` - a field on the **holder
object itself** - while bare `$$` is `$._` (the value slot). So "container-style" rules store their record as
holder FIELDS, and the holder is fresh-per-tag (`x:Rule` allocates `$x = {}`) or shared when the rule is called
untagged. That is the precise dividing line:

| Rules | Holder | `$$.field` uses | Migration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FuncCall`, `Argument` | inherited/shared across the postfix chain | `++`/`+=` **accumulate** | **return-and-merge** (hard core) |
| `TypeDeclr`, `ExternDecl`, `VarDecl`, `ArrayDecl` | own record (fresh, captured by a tagged parent) | all `=` **set** | **add `$$ = {}`** (mechanical) |

**Both migration paths are now validated on the real generator**, not asserted:

- Self-container path: [`selfContainerProto.jspeg`](selfContainerProto.jspeg) (`item <- key:Id '=' val:Num
  { $$ = {}; $$.k = $key; $$.v = $val; … }`) compiled by the value-returning generator returns
  `{"k":"foo","v":42,"tag":"rec"}` - `$$ = {}` init + `$$.field =` on the local + tagged captures all work.
- Core protocol path: `jspegTest` 9/9 (arithmetic, accumulator loops, passthrough).

The return-and-merge path for the hard core is designed (above) but not yet built - that is the first coding step
of M3 proper.

## M3 is a big-bang, not incremental - the toolchain constraint

Important sequencing reality found in M1: `impala.jspeg` is compiled by the **holder-based** production generator
(`jspegCompiler.js` via `updateJSPEG.js`). A value-returning rewrite of any rule miscompiles under that generator,
so rules **cannot** be migrated one-at-a-time against the production toolchain. M3 therefore switches the
generator (use the value-returning prototype-derived generator for `impala.jspeg`) and migrates **all** sites
in one gated step - verifiable but not incrementally reviewable - **unless** a dual-mode generator (understands
both `._` and value styles) is built first to allow staged migration. Decide dual-mode-vs-big-bang at the top of
M3; the byte-identical corpus parity gate makes either safe to *verify*.

Order for M3 proper: (0) decide dual-mode vs big-bang; (1) self-host the value-returning generator (move the
self-grammar's `vi/tag/vr` onto the `$` context param) so it can be the toolchain generator; (2) `Argument`/
`FuncCall` return-and-merge; (3) the four declaration rules gain `$$ = {}`; (4) the ~119 mechanical sites;
(5) switch `updateJSPEG.js` and prove byte-identical `.gazl` on the full corpus.

## DECISION: dual-mode - and it is validated, so M3 IS incrementally reviewable (2026-08-28)

Dual-mode chosen, and the enabling insight is now proven: **the holder's `._` field already IS the transfer
register.** Every generated rule (holder OR value style) writes its value to `$._`; captures read `$._`. So a
value-style rule needs only to (a) use a local `_v` and plain-local tags internally, (b) suppress the `._`
heuristic in its actions, and (c) **bridge `$._ = _v` on success**. Holder-style rules are completely unchanged.
Both styles then interoperate through `._` with zero glue.

**Validated** by [`dualModeProto.js`](dualModeProto.js): a hand-written parser mixing holder-style
(`root`/`product`/`group`/`_`) and value-style-bridged (`expr`/`number`) rules computes all 9 arithmetic cases,
with the style boundary crossed in **both** directions (holder `product`→value `number`; value `expr`→holder
`product`). So a rule can be migrated to value style **independently**, and it keeps working alongside unmigrated
rules - the migration is rule-by-rule under the byte-identical parity gate, not a big-bang. `_val` (the global
register) is not needed for the transition; it becomes a *final* mechanical step (rename `$._`→`_val`, drop the
holder param) once every rule is value style.

Revised M3 order (dual-mode): (1) extend the generator with a **per-rule value-style flag** (a marker or a
name-set) that switches action-rewriting to the value style and appends the `$._ = _v` bridge - a small addition
to the prototype's Definition/Action/Tagged/Capture; (2) migrate rules to value style in reviewable batches
(mechanical self-containers, then the `Argument`/`FuncCall` return-and-merge as one unit), each behind
`node impala/updateJSPEG.js` + `tools/test-js` byte-identical; (3) when the last rule flips, do the final
`$._`→`_val` + drop-holder mechanical pass and delete the holder machinery (M4).

Everything through here is de-risked with runnable proofs; the next coding step is the per-rule value-style flag
in the generator.

## Relationship to the other jspeg work

- **[`RefactorPlan.md`](RefactorPlan.md) (return-style helpers) becomes moot for its stated goal.** That plan
  reduces the number of *holder-touching* action sites while **keeping** the container; this change removes the
  container outright. If this lands we do not also need RefactorPlan - but its milestone discipline
  (behavior-preserving, fixture-gated, one reviewable step at a time) is the model this plan follows. Do not
  invest in RefactorPlan's `binaryRet`/`lookupRet` wrappers as a prerequisite; they would be migrated away
  again.
- **Two-phase AST (Problem 1) is orthogonal.** It pairs *naturally* with it (in two-phase style `$$` is
  just the node under construction and the holder question evaporates), but neither waits for the other and this
  plan does not touch the `dry`/`FuncCall` speculation patches.

## State at the start (verified 2026-08-28)

- **125** `$$.` holder-escape sites in `impala/impala.jspeg` - the mechanical migration surface.
- **0** return-style `Ret(` helpers present (RefactorPlan is genuinely 0/8, nothing to unwind).
- `impala/impala.node.js` (fast dev compiler) exists; `tools/test-js.{sh,cmd}` is the parity gate.

## Guardrails

- **The parity fixtures are the spec.** Generated `.gazl` output must stay **byte-identical** across every
  milestone - `tools/test-js.{sh,cmd}` runs the corpus byte-compare plus the NuXJS parity set. A milestone is
  not done until that gate is green. Behavior change, if any is ever intended, is a separate reviewed step.
- Regenerate generated files with `node impala/updateJSPEG.js` after any grammar/generator edit; run
  `node impala/updateJSPEG.js --check` to confirm the checked-in generator is current.
- **NuXJS-safe by construction.** The generator and the compiler it emits must run under NuXJS; avoid JS
  features NuXJS lacks (no `.map`, ES3-level). The NuXJS parity leg of the gate enforces this.
- The generator change and the `impala.jspeg` action migration are **coupled** (the generator decides how an
  action's `$name`/`$$` is read). M1 must decide whether a **dual-mode generator** (understands both the old
  `._` style and the new value style during transition, enabling incremental site migration) is feasible, or
  whether the switch is **atomic** (generator + all 125 sites in one gated step). Prefer dual-mode if it is not
  hacky; fall back to atomic, which the byte-identical gate still makes verifiable even if it is a large review.
- Keep the old holder machinery in the generator until every site is migrated and the gate proves it unused.

## Milestones

### M1 - Protocol design + generator prototype
Goal: settle the value/success protocol (**done - the `_val`-register split, see M1 findings above**) and prove a
value-returning *emission* on throwaway grammars before any `impala.jspeg` exposure.
- ~~Choose among the candidate protocols~~ - **done**: `_val` return-register for the value, boolean success
  unchanged, `$` retained as the downward context param. Recorded above.
- Prototype the new emission in the generator and prove it compiles `impala/jspegTest.jspeg` and
  `impala/tagCaptureTest.jspeg` to working parsers. **Note the inversion (M1 findings): the self-grammar is the
  *hard* case (it threads `vi/tag/vr` down), so it is not the right first prototype - validate on the small
  grammars and an `impala.jspeg` subset first, and treat self-hosting `jspegCompiler.js` as its own step.**
- Decide dual-mode-vs-atomic (see guardrails) and record it.
- Exit: a working value-returning emission for the small grammars + a written protocol/transition decision
  (protocol done; emission prototype + transition decision remain).

### M2 - Generator self-hosting fixed point
Goal: the new generator regenerates itself stably and behaves identically on the small grammars.
- Feed the new `jspeg.jspeg` through the new generator; confirm a fixed point (regenerating again is a no-op).
- Confirm byte-identical parser behavior on `jspegTest` / `tagCaptureTest` outputs.
- Exit: `node impala/updateJSPEG.js` is stable under the new generator; self-grammar tests pass.

### M3 - Migrate `impala.jspeg` actions to the value style
Goal: convert the 125 `$$.` sites and the implicit `$name._` reads to plain-variable form.
- Migrate in reviewable batches by rule family (expressions → assignment → calls → control flow), mirroring
  RefactorPlan's risk ordering, if dual-mode (M1) allows incremental migration; otherwise stage the edits and
  land them together with the generator switch.
- Audit tag rebinding (a name reused as a tag in more than one alternative) - the one place plain locals differ
  from per-alternative holders.
- Keep generated `.gazl` byte-identical after each batch: `node impala/updateJSPEG.js` then
  `node impala/jspegCompilerTests.js` and the full `tools/test-js` gate.
- Exit: no `$$.` holder-escape sites remain; the corpus and NuXJS parity are byte-identical.

### M4 - Delete the holder machinery from the generator
Goal: remove the now-dead container support.
- Remove the `={}` holder allocation (`Tagged`/`Definition`) and the `._` heuristics (`Action`) from
  `jspeg.jspeg`; regenerate.
- Search generated + source for any residual `._`/holder use; the gate must stay green with the machinery gone.
- Exit: `node impala/updateJSPEG.js --check` clean; no holder/`._` codegen remains; gate byte-identical.

### M5 - Documentation
Goal: describe the final value model for future grammar authors.
- Rewrite the holder/`._` semantics section of [`JSPEG.md`](JSPEG.md) as the value-returning model; delete the
  duality material.
- Fold the outcome back into [`JSPEGFuture.md`](JSPEGFuture.md) (Problem 2 resolved) and retire this plan's
  "not started" status.
- Exit: docs describe only the value-returning model; no obsolete holder/`._` references remain.

## Risks / open questions

- **The protocol choice (M1) is the whole risk.** If none of the candidates yields byte-identical output
  without ugly special-casing, stop and reconsider scope before touching `impala.jspeg`.
- **Zero-width and falsy values.** Any protocol must distinguish "matched, produced a falsy/empty value" from
  "failed" - the FAIL-sentinel and position-delta options handle this differently; the prototype must cover a
  rule that legitimately yields `''`, `0`, or `undefined`.
- **Dual-mode feasibility** decides whether M3 is incremental or a single large gated commit; the byte-identical
  fixtures make either safe to *verify*, but not equally easy to *review*.
- **NuXJS.** Any new generator idiom must clear the NuXJS parity leg; the safest posture is to reuse constructs
  the current generator already emits.

## M3 IN PROGRESS - dual-mode + two-pass generator built, all self-containers migrated (2026-08-28)

The dual-mode generator (option B) is **built, in the production `jspeg.jspeg`/`jspegCompiler.js`, and gate-green**:

- **Dual-mode:** a rule marked `<=` emits value-style (`var _v`, plain-local tags, no `._` heuristic, bridge
  `$._ = _v` at the end); `<-` rules are unchanged. Both interoperate through `$._`. Byte-identical with no rule
  marked.
- **Two-pass:** the generator prelude pre-scans the grammar for `Name <=` (`_vsRules`); a capture of a value-style
  rule is marked so the Action rewriter emits `._` on it (`$x.field` → `$x._.field`), letting a holder-style
  caller read a value rule's fields. Detection scans **all** rule references in a tagged Suffix, so a value rule
  inside a tagged group (`v:(VarDecl / ArrayDecl)`) is found too.

**Self-containers migrated (each: flip `<-`→`<=`, add `$$ = {}`, regenerate, byte-identical `.gazl`, full gate):**
`TypeDeclr`, `VarDecl`, `ArrayDecl`, `ExternDecl` - **all four done.**

**Two interop wrinkles the gate caught and were fixed locally (both byte-identical):**
1. **Tagged groups** - the first cut of the two-pass only saw a bare rule ref; extended to scan every rule ref in
   the Suffix (fixes `v:(VarDecl / ArrayDecl)`).
2. **Untagged-sharing site** - `ExternDecl` had a bare `VarDecl` filling its shared holder (the inherited-container
   idiom). Tagged it (`d:VarDecl { $$.type = $d.type; … }`) mirroring the existing `ArrayDecl` branch. This is the
   same class of thing the `FuncCall`/`Argument` hard core needs, in miniature - expect a few more such sites.

**Remaining M3:** the `FuncCall`/`Argument` return-and-merge hard core; the ~119 mechanical value sites (each a
flip + gate, watching for untagged-sharing sites to tag); then **M4** - once every rule is `<=`, delete the whole
dual-mode/two-pass/holder scaffolding and collapse `$._`→`_val`, param-less.

## M3 mechanical batch (2026-08-28): 9 leaf rules + the shape of what's left

Migrated (byte-identical, full gate): the scalar-capture leaves `ADDSUB_OP`, `MULDIV_OP`, `BITWISE_OP`,
`PREFIX_OP`, `BUILT_IN`, `IntegerLiteral`, `FloatLiteral`, `StringLiteral`, and `TypeBase`. **13 rules total now
value-style** (these + the 4 self-containers).

**The "~119 mechanical sites" are not uniformly a flip.** Trying `Identifier` (22 errors, reverted) showed the
remaining rules split three ways:
1. **Clean leaves** - scalar/record consumed via tags. Flip + gate (done above).
2. **Untagged-sharing rules** - used bare somewhere, so a consumer reads them via `$$`-sharing. Each needs its
   untagged sites tagged first (the `ExternDecl`-`VarDecl` fix). `Identifier` is this, with *many* consumers.
3. **The expression precedence chain** (`Expr`/`Bitwise`/`AddSub`/`MulDiv`/`PrePost`/`Comp`/`Value`/`Subscript`/
   `FieldAccess`) - shares `$$` up the chain like the `FuncCall` postfix chain: a **second cluster** to migrate as
   a unit, not rule-by-rule.

So the real remaining M3 is: a few more clean leaves; then per-rule tagging for the untagged-sharing rules; then
the two clusters (expression chain, call chain incl. `FuncCall`/`Argument` return-and-merge). The
dual-mode/two-pass machinery handles all of it - it is surgery, not trivial flips. Then M4 deletes the scaffolding
and collapses `$._`→`_val`.

## M3 batch 2 (2026-08-28): the ~v/explicit-`._` guard, then 30 more rules

**The "Identifier is untagged-sharing" diagnosis in batch 1 was wrong.** The real failure was a
double-`._`: three actions write `$label._` explicitly (`Statement`, `Goto`), and once `Identifier`
is value-style the two-pass `~v` marker *also* auto-appends `._` on that same capture → `$label._._`
→ `undefined` label (E446). Fixed at the source - the generator's Action rewriter - not per site:
the `~v`/heuristic `._`-append is now guarded by `$b.slice(0, 2) !== '._'`, so an action that already
wrote `._` is left alone. One token in `jspeg.jspeg`, byte-identical for every rule already passing,
and it is the general fix (any future value-style capture that a legacy action deref'd with `._` now
just works). With that guard, `Identifier` migrates clean - it was never an untagged-sharing rule.

**Lesson:** the "three-way split" over-counted category 2. Most rules are category 1 once the guard
is in. The genuine shared-container rules are far fewer than feared - so far only `ExternDecl`'s
`VarDecl` and (still ahead) the `Switch`/`CaseExpr` + expression/call chains that carry `$$` up.

**Also found - the `_v` register clash.** Actions wrap in an IIFE, so an author-local `var _v`
shadows the value register *inside* the action; a value-style `$$ =` there would write the IIFE-local,
not the register, and the bridge would read `undefined`. Only `BracedEntry` had one; renamed its
local `_v`→`_e` (byte-identical). Grep `\b_v\b` before migrating any rule with hand-written locals.

**Migrated this batch (each byte-identical, full gate green):**
- `Identifier` (+ the generator guard).
- 14 self-contained statement rules: `Assert` `Block` `Goto` `Return` `Break` `Continue` `If`
  `DoWhile` `Loop` `For` `Copy` `Destructure` `DestTarget` `While`.
- 6 array-builders: `Braced` `BracedEntry` `BracedItem` `InitList` `ArgsDecl` `LocalsDecl`.
- 7 self-contained decl rules: `ImportDecl` `ExportDecl` `StructDecl` `FuncTypeDecl` `ConstDecl`
  `GlobalDecl` `FuncDecl`.

**43 rules now value-style.** The recipe for a self-contained rule (no `$$` read that a *caller*
depends on) is a pure arrow flip: `grep '\$\$([^psi]|$)'` a rule's body (minus `$$parser/$$s/$$i`);
if it never touches the holder value, `<-`→`<=` is byte-identical. Container-builders that assign
`$$` and are read *via a tag* also just flip (the `~v` marker feeds the caller). What is left needs
real design: `root`/`Variable`; `Switch`/`CaseExpr`; the expression chain
(`Expr`/`Bitwise`/`AddSub`/`MulDiv`/`PrePost`/`Subscript`/`FieldAccess`/`FuncCall`/`Argument`/`Group`/
`BoolGroup`/`And`/`Comp`/`Value`) which threads the result register through a shared `$$`; and the
trivial token/keyword leaves (no `$$` at all) which are a mechanical M4-sweep flip.

## M3 COMPLETE (2026-08-28): every impala.jspeg rule is value-style - and the hard core was a non-event

**The whole grammar is now `<=`, byte-identical throughout.** The "FuncCall/Argument return-and-merge
hard core" and the expression precedence chain - the parts flagged as the risky, design-heavy cluster -
turned out to need **zero special handling**. They are pure arrow flips.

**The one insight that dissolved the hard core: initialize the value register to the incoming slot.**
The generator now emits `var _v = $._;` (was `var _v;`) for every value rule. Why this is the whole game:

- Meta slots are **mutated in place, never reassigned**. `makeMeta`/`binaryOp`/`lookup`/`fieldAccess`/…
  all receive the slot object (`$._`) and fill it via `metaSlot(rec)`; the slot at `$._` is allocated
  once (`createParserContext`) and its identity is stable for the rule's lifetime.
- So aliasing `_v = $._` at entry means: a rule that only **threads** an accumulator (the expression
  chain folding `binaryOp($op, $$, $r)` in place; the postfix chain where `FuncCall`/`Subscript`/
  `FieldAccess` hang fields on the shared slot; `Switch`/`CaseExpr` reading `metaSlot($$)`) has `_v`
  pointing at the same object every helper mutates, and the bridge `$._ = _v` is a **no-op**.
- A rule that **builds a fresh value** (`$$ = {}`, a literal, a fold seed) simply overwrites `_v`, and
  the bridge publishes it. Byte-identical to the old `var _v;` for every such rule (they assigned `_v`
  before use anyway).

This one line retired every seed hack tried along the way (`$$ = $l` tagged-child seeds, `$$ = $._`
per-alt seeds). It also fixed a real clobber it exposed: a multi-alt rule (`Comp`) where only some alts
set `_v` had the bridge writing `$._ = undefined` on the other alts, corrupting a slot a later stage
(the assert message via `endDebugGuard`) reused. With the init, unset `_v` == the incoming slot, so the
bridge is always safe.

**Also required:** the two-pass `~v` marker + the `._`-guard (batch 2) for value-rule captures a holder
reads; and `updateJSPEG.js`'s `KEYWORD` scan now accepts either arrow (`<[-=]`).

**Migration order that worked:** self-containers/statements/decls/array-builders (flip) → arithmetic
chain via seed-and-fold (later simplified to flips by the init) → the init → everything else as flips,
incl. `FuncCall`/`Argument`/`Switch`/`CaseExpr`/`Statement`. All 101 goldens byte-identical at every step.

## What M4 is now

M4 = **delete the dual-mode scaffolding** and make value-style the only mode: drop the `<-` path and the
`.vs` threading in `jspeg.jspeg`; drop the two-pass `_vsRules` prescan + `~v` marker (with every rule
`<=`, every capture is a value capture); collapse `$._`→a single return register and make rules
param-less (`_val`), which is the actual "drop the `$` container" end-state. The `impala.jspeg` grammar
does **not** change in M4 - only the generator and the shape of the emitted functions. `jspeg.jspeg`'s
OWN rules are still holder-style and must migrate too before the `<-` path can be deleted (the generator
self-hosts). Bar stays byte-identical `.gazl`, plus NuXJS parity + fuzz.

## M4 first attempt (2026-08-28): why `jspeg.jspeg` cannot self-migrate under the alias scheme

Flipping all 40 of `jspeg.jspeg`'s own rules to `<=` fails (`TypeError: Cannot set properties of
undefined (setting 'tag')`). Reverted; tree green. Two blockers, the second fundamental:

1. **Uninitialized value slot.** `Definition` writes `$$.tag/.vi/.vr/.vs` as *context*. In value mode
   that is `_v.tag` with `_v = $._`, and a fresh sub-holder (`$x = {}`) has `$._ === undefined`. Fixable
   the usual way (`$$ = {}` first), same as the impala self-containers.

2. **The alias goes stale when a child REPLACES the value (fundamental).** `var _v = $._` works only
   because impala's meta slots are *mutated in place* - helpers fill the same object, so the alias stays
   valid. `jspeg.jspeg` builds **strings**: every rule does `$$ = '…'` / `$$ += '…'`, which **rebinds**.
   An untagged child (e.g. `Definition`'s bare `Expression`) sets its own `_v` to a new string and
   bridges `$._ = _v`; the parent's `_v`, aliased at entry, still points at the *old* value. Holder mode
   worked because parent and child literally shared one `$._` cell.

**So the `_v=$._` init is not general - it is exactly a mutate-in-place optimization.** It carried all of
impala.jspeg because that grammar threads meta-slot objects; it cannot carry a string-building grammar.

**This reorders M4.** The collapse must come first, not last:

- **Option A - tag-and-thread `jspeg.jspeg` first.** Tag every untagged value-producing child
  (`e:Expression { $$ = $e }`) so the value arrives through a capture instead of a shared cell, and move
  the threaded context (`$$.vi/.tag/.vr/.vs`) onto those sub-holders. Mechanical but invasive, and it
  churns the rules M4 is about to delete anyway.
- **Option B (recommended) - do the `_val` collapse first.** Replace the per-rule holder with a single
  return register: a rule sets `_val`, the caller reads `_val`, a tagged capture saves it to a local
  right after the call. "Child replaces the value" then works by construction (no aliasing), which
  dissolves blocker 2 *and* blocker 1, and `jspeg.jspeg` migrates without the Option-A churn. It is the
  actual "drop the `$` container" end-state, so the work is not throwaway.

Bar is unchanged: byte-identical `.gazl` (0/101) + NuXJS parity + fuzz. Note the collapse changes the
*shape* of generated `impalaCompiler.js`, which is allowed - only its **output** must be identical.

## M4 design resolved (2026-08-28): seed `_val` at tagged captures - the piece the M1 prototype lacks

The M1 emission prototype already had the target shape: param-less rules,
`var _v`, `Primary` emitting `Sub()`, eager `($x=_val,true)` captures, conditional `&&(_val=_v,true)`,
no `._`. **But porting it wholesale would break `impala.jspeg`**, because it was validated only on
`jspegTest.jspeg`, whose rules *create* their values. impala's rules do the opposite: helpers
(`makeMeta`, `binaryOp`, `lookup`, `fieldAccess`, …) **fill a caller-provided slot in place** and their
return value is discarded. Under the prototype's emission a callee starts with `_v === undefined`, so
`makeMeta($$,…)` fills a throwaway slot (`metaSlot(undefined)` → fresh, unstored) and the rule publishes
`undefined`. Today that works only because hardening pre-allocates a slot per capture
(`$x={}` → `createParserContext()` = `{_: newMetaSlot()}`).

**Resolution - seed the register from the capture's own slot, then read it back:**

```
tagged capture x:Sub   →   (_val = $x, Sub() && ($x = _val, true))
rule entry             →   var _v = _val;
rule exit (if assigns) →   && (_val = _v, true)
```

with `$x` still declared as a **pre-allocated fresh slot** (the existing `={}` → hardening path, now
yielding the bare slot rather than a `{_:}` holder). This satisfies every case at once:

- **Fill-in-place callee** (`Value`, `Subscript`, …): inherits the seeded slot via `var _v = _val`, so the
  helpers mutate exactly the object the caller will read back. No grammar change.
- **Value-replacing callee** (scalar rules: `BASE_TYPE`, literals, `$$ = {}` builders): overwrites `_v`,
  publishes `_val = _v`, and `$x = _val` picks up the new value. Fixes the stale-alias bug that blocks
  `jspeg.jspeg` (strings), because the value now travels through the register, not a captured alias.
- **Untagged child** (the shared accumulator): inherits `_val` unseeded, i.e. the parent's own `_v`
  object - the current sharing semantics, preserved.
- **Isolation**: one pre-allocated slot per capture var (unchanged from today, including reuse across
  loop iterations).
- **Passthrough**: unchanged - publish only if the rule mentions `$$`.

**So M4 needs no `impala.jspeg` edits at all** - it is generator surgery plus bootstrap plumbing:

1. `jspeg.jspeg`, value-mode branches only (holder mode untouched, since `jspeg.jspeg` is still `<-`):
   `Definition` (param-less + `_v=_val` init + `_val=_v` publish), `Primary` (`Sub()`), `Tagged` (the
   seed/read-back above, plus the `$$:` form → `(_val=_v,(…)&&(_v=_val,true))`), and the Action rewriter
   (**no `._` append in value mode** - captures hold values directly, which retires the heuristic, the
   `~v` marker and its guard for migrated rules).
2. `root`'s emitted preamble becomes `var _i=0,_im=0,_val,…,_b=root();` / `return [_b,_val,…]` when
   `_vsRules['root']`, keeping `_o` + `_o.options=_hostOptions` for the host.
3. `updateJSPEG.js` hardening: `rootInitPattern` must match the new preamble, and `$x={}` should harden
   to a bare meta slot rather than a `{_:}` holder.

Only after that does `jspeg.jspeg` migrate (blocker 2 above is gone), and only then can the `<-` path,
`.vs` threading and the `_vsRules` prescan be deleted. Bar unchanged: byte-identical `.gazl` + parity +
fuzz. **Not yet implemented** - the bootstrap (a self-hosting generator whose emitted preamble and
hardening must change together) makes this a focused push, not a tail-end edit.

## M4 LANDED (2026-08-28): the holder is gone - param-less rules + a `_val` register, byte-identical

`impala.jspeg`'s generated parser now has **zero holders, zero `._`, and 110 param-less rules**, with the
value travelling through a single `_val` register. Corpus 0/101 byte-identical, NuXJS parity, dead-strip
and fuzz 3000 all green. This is the "drop the `$` container" end-state for the real grammar.

**What it took, beyond the design already recorded above:**

1. **Seed the register at a tagged capture** - `(_val=$x, Sub() && ($x=_val, …))` with `$x` a
   pre-allocated slot. Reconciles impala's fill-in-place helpers with a register model.
2. **Restore `_val` after a capture** (`,_val=_v`). A capture hands the register to the callee; without
   putting the rule's own value back, a *following untagged* child inherits the capture's value. This is
   what broke `ConstDecl` (`makeConstant` saw an unfilled slot).
3. **Restore `_val` when a capture FAILS** - the subtle one. `((_val=$x,(Sub()))&&(…)||(_val=_v,false))`.
   PEG backtracking does not unwind the register: `PrePost`'s `op:PREFIX_OP` seeds `_val`, fails on `0`,
   and the `Value` alternative then filled the *wrong* slot (E407 "Expected constant int").
4. **Seed `_val` from the root context slot** (`var _val=_o._`). A bare `var _val` starts `undefined`, so
   the first `lookup`/`makeMeta` filled a throwaway and `assign` hit its missing-meta guard.
5. `_v` is now declared in **every** value rule (it seeds and restores the register), so it can no longer
   double as the "assigns `$$`" flag - that moved to a separate `~a` key, preserving the passthrough rule.
6. Grammar edit (the one exception to "no `impala.jspeg` changes"): the three explicit `$label._` derefs
   drop their `._`, since a capture now holds the value itself.

Hardening (`updateJSPEG.js`) moved with it: capture vars harden to a bare meta slot
(`createParserContext()._`), the root init is param-less with `_val=_o._`, and `KEYWORD`/`SYMBOL_CHAR`
are param-less.

## What is left: deleting holder mode needs the self-grammar's *downward* channel rethought

Flipping `jspeg.jspeg`'s own 40 rules still fails - but no longer from stale aliases (that is fixed).
It now fails on exactly the **downward context channel** the M1 findings called the self-grammar's hard
case: `Sequence` pre-fills `$p.vi/.tag/.vr` and then captures the value into the *same* var
(`p:(Prefix / Action)`). In holder mode `$p` was a persistent box - parent wrote `$p.vi`, child's value
landed in `$p._`, and the context survived every loop iteration. With a register, `$p = _val` **overwrites
the box with the value**, so iteration 2 hands `Prefix` a string and `Capture` dies on `_v.vr[...]`.

The fix is not more generator plumbing - it is that this context should not be threaded through holders
at all:

- `vr` (the vars map) is per-`Definition` and rules never nest, so it can simply be a generator **global**
  (`Definition` sets it; everyone reads it). That deletes the threading outright.
- `tag` is only read by `Primary` to emit a holder argument - **dead once holder mode goes**.
- `vi` appears to be write-only propagation (verify), and `vs` exists solely to select the mode - both
  disappear with dual-mode.

So the last step is one combined change: **replace `vr` threading with a global, delete the `<-` path,
`.vs`, `_vsRules`/`~v` and the `tag`/`vi` threading, and flip `jspeg.jspeg` in the same commit** - the
current dual-mode compiler builds that new generator, which is then value-only. Bar unchanged.

## COMPLETE (2026-08-28): one rule form, no holders anywhere

Both grammars are fully migrated - **150 rules, 0 holder rules, 0 rules taking a parameter, no `._`**
(the three `'$._'` left in `jspegCompiler.js` are the *sentinel string* naming the `$$` tag, not holder
access). Dual-mode, the `.vs`/`tag`/`vi` threading, the `_vsRules` prescan and the `~v` marker are all
deleted. Corpus 0/101 byte-identical, NuXJS parity, dead-strip, fuzz 3000 clean.

**The final model is simpler than the one M4 landed with: `$$` IS `_val`.** No per-rule `_v` copy and no
publish step. Getting here went through two wrong turns worth recording:

- **`var _v = _val` + publish (the M4 shape) is only correct when values are MUTATED.** It carried
  `impala.jspeg` (meta slots, filled in place) but not the self-grammar (strings, always replaced): a
  parent reading an untagged child's result got its own stale copy. Patching that with sync wrappers
  fails too, because a wrapper on the callee cannot tell whether it sits under a tag (whose seed it
  would overwrite).
- **The "assigns `$$`" flag is per-RULE, not per-alternative.** So a rule with a passthrough alternative
  (`Prefix … / Capture`) still published its stale `_v`, clobbering the child's value. That bug is
  *structural* in the copy-and-publish model, and it simply cannot occur when `$$` is the register.

With `$$` ≡ `_val`, an untagged child shares the register exactly as it used to share the holder's `_`,
so passthrough costs nothing and nothing goes stale. A tagged capture is the only thing that needs care:
it seeds the register with its own pre-allocated slot and restores the parent's on **success and
failure** (PEG backtracking does not unwind a register) - `((_sv$x=_val,_val=$x,(SUF))&&($x=_val,
_val=_sv$x,true)||(_val=_sv$x,false))`.

**Grammar edits the collapse required** (small, and all "say what you mean"): explicit `._` derefs
dropped (`$label._`, `$f._`, `$$._`); `_v`-named author locals renamed (they shadow the register inside
an action's IIFE); and in the self-grammar, tag every site that reads a child's value - including
passthrough alternatives (`/ c:Capture { $$ = $c }`) and `OPEN e:Expression CLOSE`.

**Bootstrap note.** Changing the emission model makes gen1 ≠ gen2 (gen1 is built by the *old* compiler),
so `regenerate()`'s fixed-point check fails by design. Run one extra generation by hand, write gen2 as
`jspegCompiler.js`, then the normal pipeline reaches gen2 == gen3. Verified before committing.

`LEFTARROW` now accepts `<-` and `<=` identically - JSPEG has **one** rule form. Flipping the two
grammars back to a single spelling is cosmetic and can be done any time under the same gate.

## Artifact cleanup (2026-08-29)

Four throwaway artifacts from this migration were deleted once the value model landed; git history retains
them, and what each established is already written down above.

- The M1 emission prototype - deleted. Superseded: the shape that shipped is *different*
  from it (no `_v`, no publish step - see the two wrong turns above), it still carried a literal
  `else if (false)` branch, and it was the only throwaway proof sitting in `impala/` beside the
  production grammars, where it would drift and mislead.
- `design/jspeg/dualArith.jspeg` - became byte-equivalent to the existing `impala/jspegTest.jspeg` once
  the two arrows merged.
- `design/jspeg/fieldInteropProto.jspeg` - proved holder-caller/value-callee field interop, a
  combination that no longer exists.
- `design/jspeg/auditContainer.js` - a one-shot scan for the inherited-container idiom. Its answer is
  recorded above, and it had become actively misleading: it matched `^Name <-` against a grammar that
  had none left, so it reported a clean "GO" unconditionally. (It also hardcoded an absolute path.)

`valueReturningProto.js`, `dualModeProto.js` and `selfContainerProto.jspeg` are kept: they are the
runnable evidence behind the protocol decision, and the plan cites them as such.

### Authoring hazard: reserved action locals (history)

The rule itself lives in JSPEG.md's Authoring Hazards ("Never declare `_val`, `_s` or `_i` in an
action" - a shadow is a silent miscompile). Record of how it was handled:

- Two collisions were hit during the migration (`BracedEntry`'s and `Definition`'s author locals,
  back when the register was named `_v`); both were renamed (`_e`, `_vl`).
- Enforcing the rule in the `Action` rewriter was **rejected**: it is not string-literal aware, and
  `root`'s own action emits a `"var _i=0,…"` preamble *string* that would false-positive.
- Enforcement landed one level up instead (2026-08-30): `updateJSPEG.js` refuses to harden
  `impala.jspeg` if any action declares a reserved local. `jspeg.jspeg`, which owns the false
  positive, stays covered by the doc alone - its 40 rules are stable.
- The byte-identical gate is NOT sufficient by itself: a shadow on a corpus-uncovered path (an
  error-message builder, say) changes nothing the gate compares.

## A predicate no longer disturbs the value - and why backtracking still does (2026-08-29)

`&expr` and `!expr` now save and restore `_val` around the predicate, alongside the input cursor they
already restored. A predicate consumes nothing by definition, so it should produce nothing either.
This removes a wart the grammar had worked around: `InitList`'s `!(Identifier ':')` clobbered `$$`
mid-rule, which is why its entry count was assigned at the very end. Verified with a discriminating
case - a predicate whose inner rule assigns `$$` now leaves the outer value intact.

**The obvious generalisation is wrong, and it is worth recording why.** "Every place that saves `_i`
also saves `_val`" looks like the principled invariant: it would make a failed alternative unable to
leak a value, and would have prevented the capture-restore bug this document describes. It does not
survive contact with the grammars - **a leading action's effect on `$$` is load-bearing across
alternatives**:

```
Literal  <-              { $$ = '' }
            ['] ( !['] c:Char { $$ += $c } )* ['] Spacing
          / ["] ( !["] c:Char { $$ += $c } )* ["] Spacing
```

The `{ $$ = '' }` initializer belongs to the *first* alternative. The double-quoted branch has none -
it runs with `$$` still `''` **because the single-quoted branch failed after the initializer ran**.
Restore the value at the alternation boundary and that branch starts from its seeded slot instead, so
`$$ += $c` stringifies an object; the self-hosted compiler then emits `"[object Object]\\"` for a
literal and diverges instead of reaching a fixed point (19561 → 21343 → 21664 → 94 bytes).

So the ordering is deliberate, not accidental: **an action that runs before a failure is allowed to
leave its mark.** Grammar authors rely on it to hoist a shared initializer out of parallel
alternatives. Making the value obey backtracking would be a real change to JSPEG's semantics - it
would require every alternative to initialize what it uses - and the payoff is small now that tags
restore themselves. Predicates are the one case where "no side effect" is unambiguous, so that is the
only place the restore belongs. The author-facing statement of these semantics lives in JSPEG.md
("A failed alternative keeps what its actions did").
