# Assembler-level function inlining: opportunity probe (2026-07-19)

> **PARKED on this branch.** `inline` is rejected here with `E439`; the implementation lives on branch
> `GAZL2`, which ships after Impala 2.0. Everything below is a measurement record and a design input, not
> a description of what this compiler does - the same caveat [`Inlining.md`](Inlining.md) carries, which
> this file was missing. Nothing in Impala 2.0 waits on it.

> **Status update 2026-07-27.** The placement question at the bottom of this file ("OPEN DECISION") is
> RESOLVED for the compiler half: Impala-level inlining was implemented behind an explicit `inline`
> keyword (on `GAZL2` - see the banner above).
> See `design/impala/Inlining.md` for the spec and the rules. Three findings from that work correct or
> sharpen what is written below, all measured on x64/Windows with the GAZLCmd interpreter:
>
> 1. **The "roughly 60-70%" estimate for an assembler pass measures at 73%.** Same program, three
>    lowerings, all verified to produce identical results: out-of-line call 84.66 ms, assembler-style
>    inline (body copied literally, marshalling kept) 46.89 ms, Impala-level with argument substitution
>    32.61 ms.
> 2. **Materialising a single argument costs only about 6% of the prize** (36.76 ms vs 32.61 ms). That
>    is what makes a deliberately conservative substitution rule affordable - there is no need for the

> 3. **Impala needed no new IR.** `$$parser.metacode` is already a flat
>    `{operator, type, operands[3]}` list; `flushMetaCode` renders it and then discards it with
>    `metacode.length = 0`. Capturing a body is a snapshot before that line, not an AST project. Also,

> The coverage argument below still stands and is the reason the assembler pass is not obsolete:
> `vortex` (100 call sites), `reciter` (46) and `js80rmx` (22) have no Impala source on this branch, and
> the host wrapper is generated GAZL. Impala-level inlining cannot reach any of them.

Goal: inline CALL_CVC to small non-recursive GAZL functions at assembly/finalization, benefiting BOTH engines
(interpreter drops FUNC/CALL/RETU dispatch + ipStack traffic; JIT additionally drops its CALL BARRIER, which
today kills register residency in any loop containing a call).

## Measured opportunity (native arm64)

**Per-call overhead** (synthetic pair, 20M iterations, 2-arg int callee, temp/callbench_{call,inline}.gazl):
- interpreter: 130.8 vs 77.0 ms -> **2.69 ns/call = 41% of this loop**
- JIT:          52.9 vs 22.7 ms -> **1.51 ns/call = 57% of this loop** (ipStack push/pop + tail-branches + barrier)

**Where the calls are** (static CALL& sites): the SUITE has ZERO GAZL calls in all 9 kernels - it structurally
cannot show inlining gains (explains why call overhead never appeared in suite geomeans). The shipped firmwares
are the real target: vortex 100 sites, reciter 46, specular 24, js80rmx 22, ringmod 14, mozaik 11.

**Dynamic counts** (counter-patched interpreter, 100k frames, includes the concatenated GAZL host wrapper):
most firmwares ~200k GAZL calls (2/frame - largely the wrapper's driver path), beatrick 400k (4/frame),
vortex 604k (6/frame). Note pushCall-forwarded natives (^yield->yield_) do NOT go through the CALL opcode and
are NOT inlinable; the CALL_CVC portion (driver->process(), firmware-internal helpers) IS.

**Prize estimate**: gazl_calls x per-call cost => ~0.3-1.2 ms per 100k frames = roughly **5-15% of --jit runtime
on call-heavy firmwares** (vortex, reciter-class where fixed calls dominate a small process()), and about DOUBLE
that fraction on the interpreter (2.69 vs 1.51 ns). PLUS a second-order JIT win that may exceed the direct one:
loops containing calls currently barrier every iteration and are disqualified from v2.2 residency; inlining makes
them plain loops (montecarlo-style wins become reachable for firmware code).

## Design sketch (assembler finalize-time pass)

Candidates: CALL_CVC to a function that is non-recursive (no path back to itself through CALL_CVC), contains no
CALL_VVC/SWCH complications (start strict), and is small (body <= N instructions) or called-once.
Transform per call site:
- Remap callee frame slots: the callee's OUT/INP window ALREADY overlaps the caller's transients at the call's
  window base (%N) - those references rewrite to caller-relative slots directly; callee locals/transients get
  fresh caller frame slots appended (caller FUNC frame grows; fix its C0/C1 and the stack-overflow check).
- RETU -> GOTO to the end of the inlined body (handles multi-RETU callees; lowerFunction's old first-RETU
  extent scan that could not digest them is FIXED - functions are now delimited to the next FUNC).
- Rebase internal branch offsets; SWCH tables in callees excluded initially.
- Remove the CALL/ipStack round trip entirely.
Semantics: both engines see the same finalized code, so engine-vs-engine differential holds unchanged. Fuel spend
changes (fewer instructions) - fine, it is a different program. IP_STACK_OVERFLOW can only get rarer.
DATA_STACK caveat: caller frames grow by inlined locals even on unexecuted paths -> bound the growth (budget per
function) so a program near the data-stack limit does not newly trap.
Realms (section 1.1): inlining merges callee frame realms into the caller's - only LOOSENS what is defined;
conforming programs stay conforming, and the JIT realm analysis is per-function so it stays sound.

## Placement: Impala vs the assembler (OPEN DECISION, 2026-07-20)

**Impala-level inlining** (AST/codegen transform in the compiler):
- Structured transform: typed AST, named locals, scoping - no raw slot remapping or branch rebasing; much easier
  to get right.
- UNLOCKS follow-on optimization, which is most of inlining's value in mature compilers: arguments substitute
  directly (the `MOVi %N` marshal moves disappear entirely, not just the CALL), constants propagate into the
  body, dead branches fold. An assembler pass keeps the body literal.
- Probe correction: the synthetic pair folded operands too, so the measured 1.51/2.69 ns per call is the
  IMPALA-level prize. An assembler pass without copy propagation keeps the window MOVs and captures roughly
  60-70% of it.
- Better heuristics (loop depth, size, called-once all known), tighter frames (reuse dead slots vs append-only),
  zero churn in the shipped sandbox-critical assembler.
- DISQUALIFYING LIMIT for the current corpus: only code that goes THROUGH Impala benefits. The 13 recovered
  shipped firmwares exist as .gazl (two sources no longer compile: vortex, ringmod), and the firmware host
  wrapper is GENERATED GAZL text (permut8Host.js) - its per-frame driver->process() calls are invisible to
  Impala. Impala inlining is a bet on FUTURE firmware only.

**Assembler-level** (finalize-time pass, the sketch above):
- Universal: hand-written GAZL, the wrapper, reassembled old firmware, any future frontend.
- Uniquely strong policing: an --inline toggle is directly fuzzer-diffable (inline-on vs inline-off vs the
  interpreter oracle, same program) - heavyweight argument after this week's two fuzzer-caught miscompiles.
- Costs: raw-instruction surgery in the trusted gatekeeper; no unlock effects; frames only grow; smaller
  realized per-call win (marshal moves remain).

**Assessment**: they compose rather than conflict. If sequenced: a deliberately MINIMAL assembler pass (leaf
functions, small budget - the only way to reach the recovered corpus, and fuzzer-policeable) with the fuller
inlining story in Impala, where optimization belongs, when new-firmware performance matters. Also fair to ask
whether the recovered-corpus prize (~5-15% harness benchmarks; the shipped .p8bank builds run as-is regardless)
justifies assembler churn at all. DECIDE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING.

Other placements (a GAZL->GAZL tool like gazlCompactor, text-only today) rejected: same coverage as the
assembler pass with a weaker trust/policing story.

Policing: the differential fuzzer's G4 stage already generates call-heavy programs; an --inline toggle in GAZLCmd
lets the fuzzer diff inlined-vs-not against the interpreter oracle, and the 28-firmware checksum lane gates real
code. Add fuzzer arms for multi-RETU callees and window-aliasing idioms (out-params INTO the shared window).

## Open questions
- Inline budget / size heuristic (bench-driven; start "leaf <= 16 instructions", measure).
- Interaction with function pointers: a function that is BOTH direct-called and address-taken keeps its
  out-of-line copy (inline at direct sites only).
- Whether the assembler (shipped, C++03-clean, trusted gatekeeper) is the right home vs a post-finalize
  AssembledProgram->AssembledProgram transform inside the same TU (identical coverage, less parser churn).
